Last night, they responded to a house fire that involved a mother and her young children. It definitely hit him harder than usual, as the children are all around the ages of our kids (13, 6, 4, and 9 mos). The mother, Mikala, has 2nd and 3rd degree burns on over 60% of her body, and her 6 year old son also suffered burns on his hands, feet, and back. I have never met the family, but after receiving approval from Mikala’s mother, we knew we wanted to help in any way possible.  We are teaming up with Chelsea Area Fire Authority Local 1889 to support them as much as we can.  Please help to provide some relief to Mikala, and her four beautiful children, as she recovers from injuries she suffered in the fire. These donations will be used to help support the children, who are being taken care of long-term, by Mikala’s family. Mikala has a long stay in the hospital ahead of her, but the donations will also go towards helping her start over once she is released.  Funds will be dispersed to Chelsea Area Fire Authority Local 1889, and will be given directly to the family. ",162161,200000,4 days

After many doctor visits, a trip to emergency room, CT scans and ultrasounds, an endoscopy finally revealed a tumor in his small intestine. Sadly, the tumor tested positive for cancer. After losing 35 pounds within six weeks from not being able to eat many solid foods, Darren had to undergo a very risky emergency surgery on June 21. 2021. The surgery removed his gall bladder, a portion of his small intestine, a portion of his bile duct and a portion of his pancreas which left him with a rerouted digestive system. He was released from hospital on July 7, 2021 with high hopes and a positive attitude. Darren’s surgery left him to endure 12 chemotherapy sessions.  A few will not be covered by insurance. Darren has been hospitalized twice since this surgery leaving the family with multiple bills. Many have asked how they can help. The Friends of Darren Dorsey ask you to please PRAY FOR HIS FULL RECOVERY. Anyone wishing to make a donation to assist the financial burden will be greatly appreciated.  Together, we will help Darren WIN this fight! ",36134,14000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/for-david-surette?qid=2daca84e727f6a2ae6e8c35baf33da8a,for David Surette," Hi I'm Paul Greenspan and, like so many musicians here in New England, (and indeed across the USA, France & Italy and beyond) I have learned so much from David Surette. I've learned about playing the mandolin, about what notes to play and what notes not to play, about finding joy in each other and in our musical community. His teaching, his performances, his boundless optimism and good naturedness, and his friendship have enriched so many of our lives. He and his family give so much to so many. David was first diagnosed with cancer in October 2015. It has been in multiple locations since the beginning, and he has been treating it with a variety of approaches since that initial diagnosis: several surgeries, multiple rounds of radiation, and a couple of different rounds and types of chemotherapy. Recently the disease has progressed to the point where he is going to have to stop performing and teaching, at least for a while, to fully focus on treatment and healing. David & Susie shared the following recently:  ""We would like to ask for something we have asked for in the past and which has been so helpful. We would love you all to send all the love and healing energy you can to David, and to those caring for him. I (Susie) always say, ""bless those drugs"", by which I mean both bless the fact that they exist and have given help to David, and also, let us all BLESS the drugs and imbue them with our love and blessings so they can do their best for him. So this week as we embark on the next chapter, please send all the love, prayers, strength and encouragement you can to David, his team, his medications, and we Burke girls could use a little love, too. We are not out of tricks yet; nor is David's wonderful team at Wentworth Douglass, led by the wonderful doc we met at the start of this journey and who has been a friend throughout this process, Dr. Henry Sonneborn."" With David's teaching and performances on hold, this GoFundMe campaign has the aim of helping with the economic challenges of his health care journey. All funds raised go directly to David (less the modest program fees from GoFundme: https://www.gofundme.com/c/pricing#US) ",64156,50000,4 days

Friends and Family: Please keep my family lifted up in your prayers. We have been dealt an excruciating blow and have a long battle ahead of us towards recovery. As some of you know, my sweet granddaughter, Emerlyn, was recently diagnosed with cancer. She is currently quarantined at Texas Children’s Hospital with Covid as well. It’s a blessing that both her parents have been able to quarantine in her room with her. Immediately following her diagnosis, her team of doctors began a series of tests so they can begin her treatment immediately. I know this will be a long and tedious treatment plan, but we are so blessed that she is going to receive the absolute best care from some of the most experienced doctors in this field. My son Josh and daughter-in-law Samantha are committed to being with their little girl every step of the way throughout her treatments and recovery. I would like to ask any friends or family members that are capable to please consider donating to this GoFundMe page that I am organizing for the family. Focusing 100% on their daughter, without worries or stress from mounting bills or missed wages would be a huge weight to remove from their already burdened minds, and I will do absolutely everything I can to help during this difficult time for our family. I ask again that you please keep us in your prayers. We need those most of all. God Bless you all. ",28377,40000,1-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/kelly-wilson-cancer-expense-fund?qid=2daca84e727f6a2ae6e8c35baf33da8a,Kelly Wilson Cancer Expense Fund," In March 2020, Kelly Wilson was diagnosed with stage 3 rectal cancer. Kelly’s doctors opted for a treatment plan that included 12 weeks of chemotherapy, 5 weeks of radiation therapy, and surgery to remove the malignant tumor. In November 2020, St. Francis Hospital in Long Island, NY performed the surgery to remove the tumor. Unfortunately, during the surgery cancer cells were discovered along the abdomen wall. A pathology test later confirmed that cancer had reached the abdomen. To remove the cancer from Kelly's abdomen wall, she underwent HIPEC surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. The seven-hour surgery involved a hot bath of chemotherapy medicines and required 10 days of recovery. In March of 2021, a year after her original diagnosis, Kelly had an MRI that revealed the cancer in her abdomen had returned as stage 4 rectal cancer and had metastasized to her peritoneum. Doctors restarted chemotherapy with a much more aggressive treatment while closely monitoring her CEA blood level (tumor markers). Between April 2021 and October 2021, Kelly was admitted to the hospital on six separate occasions for a litany of issues including: several small bowel obstructions, low white blood cell count, blood clots, malnutrition, frequent vomiting, nausea, dehydration, and anemia. In October of this year, surgery was scheduled to repair the bowel obstruction. During the surgery, the surgeon discovered that Kelly’s abdomen had become completely overrun with cancer and she was diagnosed with end stage carcinomatosis. Kelly’s medical team then began making plans for her transition to hospice and end-of-life care. Kelly is resting comfortably at Regional Hospice in Danbury, CT and has not only been positive and inspiring, but a true beacon of light in what has been a dark and difficult 18 months. Kelly’s husband Matt has been the definition of a warrior husband and father. He has been fighting alongside his wife everyday while working full-time, maintaining the family home, caring for a 7-year-old son and a 5-year-old daughter, staying informed of all medical updates, and handling their financial responsibilities, all while keeping an absolutely positive attitude throughout this entire harrowing experience. Kelly is a loving, caring, hopeful, beautiful woman who has brought joy to everyone she has ever been in contact with. She has shown dignity, grace, and strength in every chapter of this journey. She is a mother, a wife, a friend, a daughter, a sister, and most of all she is a FIGHTER. Kelly hasn’t lost to cancer - on the contrary she has WON. In the words of Stuart Scott, “You beat cancer by how you live, why you live and the manner in which you live”. Kelly lives for her family. The costs associated with medical bills, TPN liquid nutrition (not covered at Hospice), non-covered costs, hospice care, and end-of-life arrangements are high. The Wilson family needs our help. Please donate any amount you can, and share, and reshare.For those local donors that may come into contact with Kelly's children, or those that have children that interact with Kellys children. Please Be Aware, although they are aware mom is sick and in hospice they are not aware of the recent terminal diagnosis. Please use discretion in speaking around them.

Hello! My name is Dory Moore and I am initiating a campaign for our dear friend, Scott Johnston, and his family. Scott worked for Texas A&M Football as the Director of Football Recruiting for 5 years; it was during that time that our families became close. This September, at the age of 35, Scott was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease). ALS is a disease of the parts of the nervous system that affects voluntary muscle movement and has no cure. The diagnosis came as a complete shock as he only started experiencing symptoms earlier this year. The diagnosis itself, is scary and full of unknowns, but we are all hopeful. We want them to be able to have the peace of mind that their everyday necessities will be taken care of as well as finances to access the care Scott needs- treatments, travel, medical equipment and any other need that may arise for them.  Scott has already been forced to significantly cut back hours at work, as walking can be tiresome and laboring. He will eventually have to quit working all together as the disease progresses. They are focusing all their energy toward fighting this every step of the way. Our goal is to allow their minds and hearts to be focused on this fight, AND raising their beautiful children, and nothing else. Please keep the Johnston's in your prayers, and please consider donating to this truly wonderful family. Thanks & Gig 'em #teamscojo ",119191,150000,13-Oct-21

Friends of Henry Wasonga Abuto, today we are making an important plea for your assistance and sharing an update regarding Henry on his behalf. This Saturday, Henry suffered a very serious heart attack. His friends on site administered CPR until medics arrived. He was then rushed to Dallas Methodist where he is currently intubated and sedated. Due to his critical condition, the cardiologist said they think he’s a viable candidate for a heart transplant. Unfortunately, due to a complication in Henry’s insurance he has not been able to be transferred to a hospital (UTSW hopefully) where he can get the care he needs. Henry’s family is working around the clock to identify an insurance plan that can cover his needs. Gratefully, Henry is currently responsive and communicating a bit with Esther despite being intubated. We pray for Henry’s continued improvement and the care of his current medical providers. HELP IS NEEDED His family is in dire need of funds to cover medical bills and living expenses due to some major hurdles with insurance, currently. As you can imagine, Henry’s situation means he is currently unable to work and is incurring a great deal of medical expenses. In addition, the follow up care for a transplant patient is very expensive and his viability as a transplant patient will depend on his ability to afford that post-transplant medical care. If you feel so called, please send any funds to help cover these costs to his twin sister Esther. Let’s fight for the man who has always been an advocate to us. We ask that you continue to pray and send love to Henry as we fight to obtain the care he needs. PLEASE CHECK BACK TO HENRY’S PAGE FOR UPDATES AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE ",88140,250000,4 days

He has been receiving incredible treatment at Hackensack Hospital for the last 3 weeks. While quarantined with COVID-19 at home, his lungs were being attacked and his breathing was becoming more labored with every day that passed. He was then admitted to the hospital and about a week later he was in critical condition and needed to be put on a ventilator. Anthony had a tracheotomy procedure shortly after and has been on an ECMO machine, which pumps and oxygenates his blood outside his body, allowing his heart and lungs to rest. These machines, along with his faith, our prayers, and God are saving his life right now! We know he is receiving the best care from the doctors and nurses in the ICU and are eternally grateful to them, but we also know the cost that care comes with. In an effort to ease this hardship and burden of the anticipated medical bills, we are asking for everyone's continued love, prayers, and support to help Ashley, Anthony, little Anthony,(6) Talia,(3) and Layla(11 months). Anthony is facing a long road to recovery, not only emotionally and physically, but medically and financially as well. All funds raised will go directly to his medical costs and related recovery treatment. Please consider donating what you can and share this page with as many people to help their family.Anthony is 42 years young. He owns and operates the BP Gas Station in our hometown of Totowa. He works tirelessly to provide for his family and is an amazing father. He is always surrounded and blessed by his three beautiful children and wife, loving mom and dad, brother and two sisters, among his many other family and friends. All who know Anthony know he has never hesitated to help others in any way he could, whether it be a friend, a family member, or a stranger. He is strong, positive, and grateful for his life and we know he wants it back. Anthony deserves to live life as he had prior to his fight with COVID-19. We continue to pray that someday soon he will be strong enough to tell his story and to express his gratitude for everybody who stood beside him and his family in his fight.Ashley is so grateful for everything everyone has done and continues to do for her and her family. She is humbled by all the help, the outpouring of love, prayers, friendship, food, and the countless acts of kindness everyone has shown her and her family during this very difficult time. Everyone is holding onto the hope that Anthony will continue to fight for his life and knows he wants to come home to his family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/eric-flying-a-go-around,Eric flying a Go Around,"Felicia Klootwyk is organizing this fundraiser. Hello, this is the Klootwyk family’s GoFundMe page. On September 5th, 2021 my husband Eric, father to our 3 young children, had a grand mal seizure. This led doctors to discover and remove a tumor from his brain that was determined to be a grade 4 Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is very aggressive cancer.  https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/understanding-glioblastoma.h00-158828856.html When the seizure occurred, Eric was at work piloting an airplane into Boston’s Logan Airport. After he landed, the left side of his body became numb, he felt a tremendous weight on his body, and then he lost consciousness. The next thing he remembers is waking up in the Emergency Room of Mass General Hospital. After an MRI, a tumor was discovered on his brain, in the frontal lobe, just above his right ear. Removing the tumor was the crucial and unavoidable next step. I arrived as fast as I could, flying across the country, arriving the night before his surgery. After nearly 2 hours of surgery, the skilled neurosurgery team at Mass General removed the tumor successfully. Unfortunately, with Glioblastoma, standard of care isn’t usually enough. Long-term survival is 12-18 months. We were told to seek out clinical trials for a better outcome. We found a team of neuro oncologists at St. John’s hospital in Santa Monica running a clinical trial that resonated with Eric. He starts the 6-week trial on Tuesday, October 19th. The trial consists of very specialized immunotherapy and oral chemotherapy. The concept is to kick his body’s own immune system into overdrive to fight the cancerous cells. There is a lot of hope. This is an in-house trial, meaning it isn’t sponsored by a large medical corporation. Even though it is a trial, our insurance will be billed when applicable and there will be out-of-pocket expenses. The trial’s lead neuro oncologist cautioned us, in our first meeting, that if Eric needs immunotherapy treatments beyond the trial, they are experimental, not covered by insurance, and incredibly expensive. We are asking for help. At 47, Eric is otherwise in great health thanks to an active lifestyle and a young family keeping him on his toes. He has been a pilot for 20 years. Flying is his passion. He was hired by Alaska Airlines in 2016, based out of LAX. On September 3rd, he was awarded a captain’s position by Alaska Airlines. The pinnacle of his career. He was over-the-moon with happiness and accomplishment. On his very next work trip, less than 48 hours later, he had the seizure. To say that our family’s joyous balloon deflated would be an understatement. As a result of the seizure and diagnosis, Eric lost his FAA medical certification. We are uncertain if Eric will ever medically qualify to fly again, and if he does, the process will likely take years. We are strong. We love each other. We are optimistic things will work out for Eric and our young family. The support of family, friends and coworkers help remind us that our family will get by and thrive. We also commit to updating this page with Eric’s journey, and advances in treatment, in hopes that we can help anyone in a similar crisis. Please help by donating. The term “Go Around” is a maneuver term used when an airplane is setting up to land, but something changes in the plan and the pilot rejects the landing, then controls the airplane to attempt another landing. Our family is “going around”. We will land. ",113405,100000,13-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-for-the-maxwell-family,Help for the Maxwell family," Tyler and Alexus are two of the most sweet, loving and generous people I’ve ever met. Last winter they got the news that they were expecting a little baby girl after recently getting married. Everyone’s hearts were ecstatic. Alexus’ pregnancy was not the easiest, she was sick more days then she was not, she tested positive with COVID during pregnancy but they made it through it. On September 8, 2021 baby Maisley was brought into this world. Maisley has been the most amazing baby they could ever ask for she’s beautiful and she’s so calm. However, last week, just shy of six weeks old Maisley tested positive for COVID. Alexus brought her in to the doctors to be checked out after running high fevers, they sent Alexus on her way home and told her to continue monitoring Maisley, if she became inconsolable or her eating and urinating changed to bring her back. Yesterday Monday, October 25, Alexus brought Maisley back to the doctor, she was to the point of inconsolable and was not eating or urinating. Maisley’s oxygen saturations we’re at 70%, anyone not familiar with the medical field her oxygen saturations should have been above 95%. Maisley was then placed on oxygen. At that point Alexus and Maisley were transferred to Children’s Hospital in Minneapolis where Tyler joined them. Once there, Maisley went under more tests to figure out what was all going on. Some more shocking news Maisley had pneumonia as well as a partially right collapsed lung due to the respiratory stress her body was under. Maisley is currently in the PICU. She was intubated and put on the ventilator around 2:00am due to worsening of her pneumothorax (collapsed lung) and pneumonia. They also place a chest tube for the pneumothorax and NG tube due to air in stomach. Maisley has had multiple dips in oxygen saturations that required to be bagged as well as extra sources of heat. On top of being new parents, dealing with this has been the scariest situation Tyler and Alexus could’ve ever imagined. With Alexus out on maternity leave, Tyler will also have to take unpaid time off of his work to be with his family as well as quarantine, and the new stress of medical bills I’m asking you to consider donating money to help them get through this.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/mohors-cancer-treatment,Help Mohor fight Leukemia," This fundraiser is for 14-year old Mohor. I am doing this on behalf of Mohor's dad, Probal (who I have been friends with since I was 10 years old. I have posted an update under ""updates"", but the updates textbox did not allow me to post pictures, so I have  added the entire update again under the original story below). Meet Mohor - your typical 14 year old kid, busy growing up, showing streaks of independence and often giving her parents a hard time, with all the love in her heart. She loves singing - she has an angelic voice, loves to sing classical songs. She adores Bob Dylan & Joan Baez , identifies with Taylor Swift and Adele, but sways to the music of Halsey and Billie Eilish. She also loves poetry - her thoughts and words speak of a maturity far beyond the14 years she has spent on this planet. But don't be fooled by her soft demeanor and kind spirit, she is also an accomplished swimmer from when she was 4, and also a brown-black belt in Shito-ryu karate. She aspires to be that rare champion in both departments of the sport, Kata (shadow-fighting) and Kumite (fight). She was so happy to see the event included in the Tokyo Olympics earlier this year! She has the soul of a poet, the wisdom of a philosopher, but aspires to have the agility of a ninja. But this is where fate has dealt her a cruel blow. Just last week, she and her parents received the worst news any child can ever get: she has now been diagnosed with Acute lymphocytic/lymphoblastic leukemia, also known as ALL, a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This can progress very rapidly, and can create immature white blood cells in an uncontrolled manner. This is a kind of cancer that needs immediate intense treatment over the next 24-36 months, with bulk of the treatments being administered in the first few months. She is surrounded by her loved ones, her parents Probal and Surasree are giving her strength, but are also drawing their strength from Mohor. (Mohor with her mother Surasree and father Probal) She is currently undergoing treatment at Tata Medical Center – Cancer Hospital & Research Center. Initial estimates for the first round of chemotherapy and related tests are expected to be around $20,000 in the first 6 months, with the total cost of treatment over the next 36 months expected to be more than double that. (Mohor just before her bone marrow test at TMC Kolkata) Her parents have medical insurance, but it will cover less than $5,000 of the total costs. So I am asking you to open up your hearts, and donate whatever you can, to enable a teenager to live her dream - of growing up and taking on the world's challenges head on! That's all she is asking for - a shot at life, a chance to grow up, and go to college, spend time with her friends, and bring joy to everyone around her, and hopefully someday give something back to the world. If you are unable to donate financially, please share this message amongst your friends, and please keep her and her family in your thoughts. She and her family hope to draw their strength from your support, both your words of encouragement as well your financial support. Update as of October 29, 2021It has been less than 72 hours since we launched this fundraiser (Tuesday October 26, 6 PM US Eastern Time), and what an amazing heartwarming 72 hours it has been! So many of you have opened up your hearts and your pocketbooks to support this amazing teenager. A lot of you reached out with sincere messages of support and encouragement. I have been constantly passing them on to the family, and they are overwhelmed by this outpouring of support that they have received thus far. A lot of you know me and/or the family personally. But a significant number of you are complete strangers, who are moved by this little girl’s story and have come forward to help this family. To all of you, friends and strangers alike,  I would like to convey our sincere gratitude. Merely saying “Thank you” is probably a huge understatement.I do want to take this opportunity to post a few updates.How is Mohor doing?She has gone through the first battery of tests at the Tata Medical Center in Kolkata, where she has been admitted since Sunday Oct 24. Dr. Niharendu Ghara and his fantastic team have been absolutely amazing with her so far. She is in good sprits for now, considering what she is going through. Your messages are playing a big role in keeping her spirits up, so please keep them coming. Since this treatment is a long journey of 2-3 years her family have moved into a temporary rental apartment, closer to the hospital. This will save her the long commuting time between where she currently lives and where the hospital is.Below is a screenshot of her initial tests / expenses, from the day she was admitted. How are we doing financially?As I had stated in the original fundraiser, the total expected cost over a 2-3 year period can run up to $45,000 (INR 3,200,000 a.k.a. 32 Lakh Indian Rupees), with at least $15K needed in the first few months. In order to reach the widest possible audience, we created two parallel fundraisers: One here at GoFundMe, and one targeted at Indian donors in Milaap. This is the link to the Milaap Fundraiser . As of writing this update we have had 314 donations on GoFundMe totaling $20,600 and 524 donations on Milaap totaling ~$18,700. Adjusting for payment gateway fees, we are still about $8,000-$10,000 short of our stated goal. But we are very close and cannot afford to lose the momentum now. So please continue to share this as much as you can.How do we plan to send the GoFundMe funds to Mohor’s family?GoFundMe does not operate in India. Based on GoFundme’s guidelines (as stated on this page ), I am responsible for sending these funds to the beneficiary. I have received banking details from Tata Medical Center that will allow me to send the funds directly to the hospital’s bank account, for the benefit of the patient. Here are the details of the bank account details, and as soon as I start sending the funds, I will post regular screenshots of the wire transfer confirmations. Once GoFundme allows me to withdraw funds, it will take between 7-10 days for me to transfer the funds to he hospital. How will Probal pay bills in the interim?Probal will continue to use his personal funds to pay interim hospital bills. Here is an example of the bill he had to settle earlier today. All these bills mention Divsha Ray, but this fundraiser is for Mohor. How are they related?In our Indian cultural context, most of us have legal names for the world outside, and a nickname or favored name that near and dear ones use. Divsha Ray is lovingly called Mohor by her parents, family and friends. Mohor means precious!Here is a copy of Divsha / Mohor’s Aadhar ID card, showing her picture and her father Probal’s name. I will provide more updates as and when they are available. In the meantime, please continue to keep her in your thoughts and share her story amongst your family and friends. Mohor’s parents, Probal and Surasree, are truly humbled by the love that you have showered on their daughter. ",21476,25000,5 days

He is 18 years old full of life and energy and what I love about him is his will to change the world to a better place. On October 9th, 2021 I received the worset news I could possibly imagine. Gorge was admitted to an emergency room in the city of Dohuk northern Iraq due to severe brain damage after he was accidentally electrocuted. The electric shock caused his heart to stop for a few minutes and that resulted in a lack of oxygen to his brain which lead to severe damage and sent him to a coma for a few days. After he woke up he started to have seizures and abnormal body activities. It has been over two weeks now and he is still in critical condition.  While his parents are devastated and heartbroken for what happened to their only son, the medical bills and medication are causing another burden for them. They are receiving all the possible help from close family members and friends but that is still far from enough.  I'm his uncle and I'm asking YOU all for your help to bring this young man to his normal life. Your financial support and your prayer will ease the burden on his parents and will put their focus on their son. Please if you can't help share his story with your family and friends God bless you all.  ",38633,30000,5 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/gabe-hefner-hospital-bills,Gabe Heefner Go Fund Me," Lance Corporal, GABE HEEFNER, 20 year old young man who joined the Marines and trained to be a Transmission Systems Operator (0621). He was the number one student out of his class of 45 students, and was recently meritoriously promoted to Lance Corporal. Gabe attended Kirkwood High School, in Kirkwood, Missouri (a suburb of St. Louis), and graduated in 2020. On Sunday evening, Oct. 17th, Gabe, the son of Nile & Codi Heefner, who reside in St. Louis, Missouri, was shot in the head while driving back to his grandparent’s home (around 6pm). Gabe was home on leave from the Marines, and was in Iowa City visiting his grandparents and friends that attend the University of Iowa. Gabe’s parents received a call from the police, around 6:45pm, telling them they were with him and that he had been in a car accident. They found out more details once Gabe’s grandparents got to the hospital, and it was reported that his car had veered across the median on Highway 6 and came to a stop in the ditch, because he was shot in the head. At that time, he was able to tell first responders his name and speak in complete sentences, though his sentences weren’t making sense. He was able to respond to commands on his right side. Things when downhill later that evening, and doctors ended up having to remove part of the left side of his skull to allow for the swelling in his brain. Praise God they did that because it helped his pressure levels go back to normal when they had been doubled previously. The doctors informed Gabe’s parents that they will not be able to remove the bullet from his head. The left side of his body (though he can move his arm and leg on that side when prodded and given pain stimuli) has been a problem this whole time, due to the location of the bullet that is still lodged in the middle of his brain, so regaining movement on his left side is a huge prayer request. They say it is incredible that he survived, and he could talk and respond upon entrance to the trauma center. Now it is just a waiting game to see how he responds once he regains full consciousness. PLEASE and most importantly, keep Gabe in your thoughts and prayers. We pray that God will bless over him, and that Gabe will remain strong during the recovery process. Since Gabe is in the Marines, they will be taking care of his medical bills. Gabe’s family will incur many expenses traveling back and forth to Iowa City from St. Louis (gas, food, oil changes, maintenance, etc.). Gabe’s mother is a school teacher and his father is a salesman (commission only) for a fencing company.  Any donation or support would be greatly appreciated to assist Gabe and his family during this truly tragic and senseless random shooting!Thank you and God bless!",63373,60000,20-Oct-21

If you know her, you have been inspired by her drive and passion for life. In June 2021, a tumor was found on the bile ducts in Anna's liver and confirmed to be intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).  In July, she underwent a complicated surgery to remove the tumor and reconstruct the intestinal connection to her liver - it took 9 hours. That surgery was not successful in removing all of the cancer or it had already spread before the surgery because, in September, a PET scan and biopsy showed that a spot in Anna’s pelvis was malignant- meaning the cancer had spread.Bile duct cancers are rare, little research exists, and current chemo-based treatments for her diagnosis yield an average life span of about 12-18 months. Anna’s desire is to live well and be physically and emotionally present with her family throughout this journey. Just like with her patients, she is taking a holistic approach to her care plan and is seeking out innovative treatments and clinical trials that align with those goals.We are raising funds for Anna and the Nieboer family to help provide for her medical care and any other needs that arise in the coming year. Current expenses include: working with a consulting oncologist (Dr. Jason Sager at Sagely Health) who will help search for the best innovative treatments specific to Anna’s diagnosis; advanced biomarker/genetic testing to qualify her for clinical trials; and travel to MD Anderson or other clinical trial sites. Both Anna and Andrew expect to miss work time and income while some of these treatments are pursued. Our hope is that this fundraiser is a way to relieve a small part of their burden during this time.Every donation is appreciated and Anna and her family are so grateful for your love, prayers, and well wishes. They have already been blown away by the financial support, meals, toys, and well-wishes they have received.

While he was declared cancer-free in September 2020, he was expected to undergo two full years of chemotherapy. Devastatingly, in October 2021, a batch of suspicious cells in his spinal fluid showed evidence that his disease had returned in his central nervous system. James has more intense chemotherapy, radiation, and an allogeneic stem cell transplant in his future. This means countless more trips to Boston (including a one-month stay during James’ anticipated transplant), more childcare for Nathaniel and Anna, more meals on the road, and more missed work for Kate and Mike. Here is where we can help. Together, we can make this scary time a little more manageable for the McCary family. Please donate so the McCarys know that we are committed to getting them through this, and so James knows he has countless supporters cheering him on through this next phase of treatment.Any unneeded funds will be donated to The Jimmy Fund to benefit other kids fighting cancer.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-fix-my-brain,Help fix my brain," UPDATE: I recently learned from my doctor that I also am suffering from a venous aneurysm that has thankfully yet to burst, so time is more of the essence than I initially thoight. Doctor's notes are in the updates section!Toward the tail end of this March, my life suddenly changed for the worse. I woke up and was immediately hit with a bout of vertigo and a splitting headache. The hearing in my left ear was muffled and strange, and I could hear my heart loudly pounding away in that ear. I went to urgent care, where I was told I probably had an ear infection. Little did I know, that was entirely wrong. It was just the start of my journey to a diagnosis. All of those issues have remained constant problems in my life since then. I'm constantly at least a little dizzy and often find myself nearly passing out, my skull generally feels like it's about to split open from pressure, and my hearing continues to get worse while silence has become something I only get to experience while I'm asleep. I worked constantly since that initial diagnosis to figure out what was wrong, sinking most of my savings into it, and came up empty-handed time and time again. It was only in late October that I got a concrete answer. After months of searching and being told I had to live like this, I had an answer and a treatment. my brain :) It all comes down to the veins in my brain being, in essence, a mess. I was born with such underdeveloped veins in the right side of my brain that they may as well be absent. This isn't a problem on its own, as my left side has developed to compensate for it. However, my left side, for currently unknown reasons, has begun to narrow in several spots. This is choking the bloodflow in my head even further, and my lack of useful veins on the right side makes this a problem. My brain's bloodflow is strangled, turbulent, and is creating a bunch of pressure in my head. This also explains why I hear my own heartbeat and not much else in my left ear, the primary narrowed vein is right near my ear and is more forceful than it should be. This condition also has potential to increase my risk of brain blood clotting / stroke. Generally, narrowing either gets worse or stays the same. It does not get better on its own, and there isn't really a way to project if it will get worse or not. If mine gets worse, I'm in danger due to my absence of veins on the right side. Therefore, it's something I need to get treated sooner rather than later. There's a light at the end of the tunnel. Via a relatively new procedure, some doctors can place a stent in the narrowed veins in my brain to force them back to their proper width and prevent them from renarrowing. I have already talked to a doctor who thinks I'm a great candidate for this procedure. it'll look like this The problem is that this doctor is out of state, and my insurance won't cover this procedure. In addition, though I am at notably increased risk of several potential fatal neurological problems due to this issue, I haven't had a stroke yet (which is... probably a good thing.) This means that this would be seen as an elective surgery, and there is no guarantee I will be able to get a better plan to cover it either. It's very likely that I will have to pay for this out of pocket. But, ultimately, I can't and shouldn't live with this. The symptoms I deal with have upended my life and have made everything far harder for me than it used to be. The constant fear that this could easily get worse is a dark cloud over my life as well. Please help me get my life back. ",12140,25000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/achilles-heal,Achilles heal," As you can imagine, tearing your Achilles tendon is one of the most painful and debilitating injuries.That’s exactly what happened to Fadi during the last song of the Riverboat Gamblers set at Punk Rock Bowling in Las Vegas late September. In an otherwise flawless show, a combination of wear and bad luck led to a full rupture of his right Achilles tendon (We didn't know this for sure till we got back to Austin). Excruciating pain, medics, and cheap crutches got him back to Austin where doctors confirmed what we feared: surgery was necessary ASAP. On top of giant hospital, doctor, and surgical fees, he was informed he would need a 6 month recovery period. No walking, no working, no driving. Fadi is an independent contractor, home inspector, and carpenter. He works on his feet and with his hands. It’s going to be impossible for him to do any of this while he heals. The doctors won't even start physical therapy until early next year. On top of being out of work, he's got an active, precocious 7 year old daughter and an infirmed mother for whom he is the only family in town to give care. He’s got hefty hospital bills, lots of upcoming physical therapy, and no way to make any income for at least 6 months. We are making this GoFundMe to help ease the financial burden that is weighing on him and his family. Even a few bucks would really help while we scramble to figure some of this stuff out.

I understand this path for Layla is paved with unknowns so Robbin and Laura may not know exactly what they need from all of us right now, but I want to be proactive.  Even with good health insurance, medical bills can pile up and the possible reduction in wages for Robbin and Laura during Layla's treatments could cause added stress to this situation.

She had to be life flighted to the nearest level 1 trauma medical center where she is currently in critical condition. Her injuries are severe and will alter her life forever. In the last 3 days she has undergone surgeries to remove her ruptured spleen, repair multiple breaks in both of her legs, pelvic bone and shattered foot, a tracheostomy procedure, and facial reconstruction of her jaw, nose, and cheek bones. Currently she is heavily sedated and may not be able to speak or move for several weeks. We are unsure of what her mobility will be like in the future and are preparing for years of rehabilitation.  Jenny is the strongest person I know and, unfortunately, is all too familiar with hospitals. She was born with cystic fibrosis (CF) and it’s truly a miracle that her compromised lungs were not injured in the crash. She has had too many hospitalizations to count throughout her young life and has come out of each one fighting harder. Jenny never let CF hold her back and was pursuing a career in photography. She has established herself as a well-respected ‘space-coast’ photographer, shooting her beloved Space X, NASA, and ULA rocket launches and booster returns. As a family, we are staying strong for Jenny and will do everything in our power to support the long journey ahead of her.

Born in Buffalo Ny, raised in Chautauqua County, now residing in Southern Maryland. I am a United States Capitol Police officer where I have served honorably for the past 19 years. I have been married to my wife for almost 15 years and have 2 wonderful children. This year has been a difficult year for many of us at work and my diagnosis makes it that much more difficult for me. This all started on June 17th after my daughter’s dance recital. We had gone out to eat after and I ended up with food poisoning from a crab cake. The symptoms would not go away, I kept having relapses and no appetite throughout July. Through persistence I was able to get numerous tests done including a CT scan. The CT showed something in my small intestine, which turned out to be Celiac Disease. On August 16th I went in for a colonoscopy and endoscopy. During the colonoscopy they found a polyp in my rectum. The following day, the surgical site started bleeding. My wife had to take me to the emergency room, by then I had lost blood I blacked out twice, my heart rate was in the 20s and I almost needed a blood transfusion. I had to have an emergency colonoscopy the next day to stop the bleeding and was hospitalized for 3 days. While admitted, I learned that the polyp was cancer.  I applied and got into Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. On September 20th I had a successful 4 1/2 hour surgery that removed the majority of my rectum, the fatty tissue around it, 17 lymph nodes and gave me a temporary ileostomy. I was in the hospital until October 6 due to several set backs. To the shock of my surgeon 1 of those 17 lymph nodes had cancer in it. Though the cancer in the rectum was Stage 1, finding it in the lymph node puts me at stage 3. I will be starting chemotherapy soon. Once they are satisfied that the chemo worked and I am healthy I will be scheduled for another surgery to reverse my ileostomy, requiring an additional hospital stay. It is going to be a long hard road. I am in really good spirits and know that I am in the best hands I can get at Hopkins. I created this gofundme account because I will soon run out of leave at work and I still have to somehow support my family. The stress of not being able provide for my family weighs on me daily. I also have increasing expensive medical bills from all my various appointments and hospital bills, not to include the chemotherapy that begins in November. My family and friends know that I am not the kind of person to ask for help like this. I have always tried to handle everything myself no matter how difficult it is. Now I am faced with Mt. Everest in my way. I have to focus on my health and recovery so that I can enjoy the rest of my life and make the best of it. I just need help to get the weight of this stress off my shoulders. I trust in God that he will see me through this. Any help is always appreciated not just by me, but also my family. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your generosity and prayers.

When the diagnosis was shared in May, he was sent home and placed immediately on workmen’s compensation. In the last month we’ve been informed that this was not the case. After 6 months worth of extensive tests, his entire case has been denied by workers compensation and he is NO longer being paid! Our Medical deductibles and long term medical costs that we’ve just been hit with will be staggering for our family. Being the primary provider for a family of four, our goal is to be able to try to keep things as “normal” as possible, hoping that we can pay the insurance deductible, while maintaining as much of a normal life for our family. If you can help, please do so through this GoFundMe link and we extend a heart felt thank you to all of our friends and family who continue to keep us in your prayers for a full recovery!

However you've been graced with Dug's presence, we can all agree that he's made a lasting impact on us all. For those who might not know him, Dugan is a GWOT Army veteran who instantly became a firearms industry icon with his comical, yet informative, channel, CarnikCon.

Though MS is treatable, it comes in debilitating waves. Unfortunately for Dugan, it appears that this wave might not be one to bounce back from. Dugan has young children, and right now they are his biggest concern. Though usually Dugan is the one to go out of his way to help us, he has come to us asking for help. He is currently undergoing treatment at the VA after being hospitalized last month, but is asking for any guidance or help in the treatment of his MS. He's come to us to ask if we can help prolong is health so that he can stay with his children a little while longer. I am starting this Fundraiser to help offset whatever financial hardships his family is facing at this time. I have been in touch with Dugan and his family and that have agreed to accept the funds raised here. Dugan Ashley will be the beneficiary for this fundraiser. Dugan has given us all so much.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/brayleighs-beating-brain-cancer,Brayleigh Beating Brain Cancer," Hi my name is Erika and I am Christi’s sister and Brayleigh’s auntie. Brayleigh was diagnosed on 10/16/2021 with Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG). Brayleigh spent a wonderful week on vacation in Florida when she began showing symptoms of left sided weakness in her hands and toes. She began to walk on her tiptoes, and she progressively developed an unsteady gait. She also has a slight facial droop and weakened swallowing muscles. Christi immediately took Brayleigh to the Emergency Room in Florida where they did a CT scan and an MRI. This is when they were told she had a tumor on her brain stem. They did not have any more information than this at that time. They took the next flight home the following morning and went straight to Children’s Hospital in Milwaukee. At Children's Hospital in Milwaukee a team of specialists got together and reviewed her case. Ultimately Christi and Pat were delivered the terrible news this was DIPG. This is a brain tumor that is highly aggressive and difficult to treat. It occurs in an area of the brainstem (the lowest, stem-like part of the brain) called the pons, which controls many of the body's most vital functions such as breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate, and every day activities such as walking and swallowing. It also affects the nerves and muscles that help us see, hear, and talk. Symptoms usually develop rapidly in the majority of patients because of the fast growth of these tumors. Unfortunately this type of tumor is inoperable and does not respond to chemotherapy due to its location in such a sensitive part of the brain. DIPG is very rare and only affects 250-300 children in the United States per year. Brayleighs daddy (Pat) and mommy (Christi) and both sides of their family have been tirelessly searching for clinical trials and other treatments to help our sweet Brayleigh. Pat and Christi will be needing assistance with gas, housing, food, and most importantly medical costs that will not be covered by insurance through this process. The last thing the two of them need to worry about right now is how they will financially afford the absolute best possible care that they can provide for her. Brayleigh will begin daily radiation treatments to slow the growth and/or shrink the tumor temporarily and hopefully be accepted into a clinical trial in the next few days. Brayleigh deserves the absolute best and we are all determined to provide it to her!! Brayleigh, Christi, and Pat truly have a village of people around them pouring in endless support. We are calling this village BRAYLEIGHVILLE. Please consider donation in support of the three of them. Any excess $ that has not been utilized through this process will then be donated to support research and further clinical trials to find a cure for this terrible type of childhood cancer. Christi and Pat are both very busy finding the best possible medical care for their daughter, as well as spending as much quality time with her as possible. If you send messages to them, please understand they are very busy and going through a tough time. Please understand that a reply might be delayed and/or difficult entirely. Thank you for your respect and consideration. Much love and positive vibes for Brayleighville! ",59737,100000,19-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-beta-and-her-family,Help Beta and her family,"Valmira Daka is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Elizabeta Glavaski. TRAGIC UPDATE!!!Hi everyone, First I want to thank you once again for all your kind hearts , generosity, and all of your prayers for my friend Beta. With a heavy heart I am here to inform you that the worst did happen and tragically Betas moms battle with cancer came to an end yesterday . May she forever Rest In Peace... As much as I wish I could have been updating this page with some positive news after her dad’s passing , unfortunately that is just not the case. So here I am again asking for you all to open your hearts to my friend one more time. She is once again faced with the hardship of having to bury yet another parent . Her moms dying wish was also to be buried back home with her husband and for Beta to take full custody of her 15 year old sister. The struggle and pain of having to send one of your parents back home in a casket again is greater then I can even imagine. Over night Beta went from being a sister to having the  responsibilities of a parent. I know that we can all pray for her but I also understand that this is a healing process and we cannot just wish the pain away. Because of you all Beta was able to bury her father honorably back home. I want to raise this money to help Beta pay for her moms funeral but also in hopes that there might be a little left over for her and her sister to fall to incase of an emergency, for her not to start all over at 0 once more. As you guys know I mentioned in the last post Beta herself is also struggling with her health, she has stomach and ovarian cysts that she was supposed to have surgery this past August , but with everything going on she had to put her own health on pause. Recently her doctors informed her that this can not wait any longer and her surgery has to happen as soon as possible to prevent a rupture. I’m hoping that we can all come together one more time to take some of the financial burden away from her. I pray that we can all help one more time to at least take one worry off of her shoulders. I know that her moms battle with leukemia left Beta with a broken heart and soul but also with a lot of bills.  It’s a scary struggle to wonder how you are supposed to bury your mom right after you just buried your dad.  It is a whole other terrifying struggle having to wonder how you are going to be able to do it financially . It makes the situation a whole lot worse . I am pleading with you all again to find it in your hearts to help my friend one more time . Everything is a blessing and no donation is too small. I thank  you all from the bottom of my heart  may God bless you all, and may he reward you infinite times for all of your generosity and kind hearts. FIRST POST!!!⬇️Hello everyone, my name is Valmira and this go fund me is to help my amazing friend Elizabeta Glavaski. To say that she has been through so much heart ache, pain , and tragedy would be such an understatement. Beta is 25 years old and has 3 younger siblings. Beta suffers from ovarian and stomach cysts and is at risk of rupture. Do to being exposed to Covid-19 her surgery had to be pushed to august 22nd and this poses a huge risk on her life since she is at risk of them rupturing. Her family was also exposed to Covid-19 and tragically on Sunday august 15 she lost her father . Her dads dying wish was to be buried back home to Yugoslavia. Right before her fathers death Betas mom Mrija rushed over to emergency in a lot of pain and weakness in her legs and the same day she went in she got diagnosed with leukemia. Now her mom is also fighting for her life. This is all too familiar to Beta and her family because the same horrible disease took her sisters life 3 years ago. To be only 25 years old and to have so much responsibility fall on her shoulders on top of her being so sick herself is just so much for one person to deal with . So now I am pleading with you all PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE help us reach our goal to help Beta And her siblings financially in these tragic turn of events that they are going through. Anything that you can possibly spare will be greatly appreciated. Please share this and help spread the word. And if I may ask you all to please PRAY for Betas health , her moms health , and for God to give them the strength to be able to withstand everything they are going through. ",46730,50000,16-Aug-21

On October 23rd, 2020 around 11:30pm, my brother, Desmond (Junior) Patterson (16) and another student at Northwood High school, Brian (17), were driving near Old Graham Rd., Pittsboro when they abruptly collided with a tree, resulting in the unfortunate passing of Brian and leading Des to fight for his life at the childrens ICU unit at UNC Hospital. Des is currently relying on lifesupport after suffering from severe brain damage caused by the impact of the wreck. With that, he’s undergone a few surgeries to remove a portion of his skull to relieve the trauma forced pressure on the brain, as well as assistance to breathe via ventilator. His left lung has collapsed and now has a tube to help drain the excess fluid around his lungs. Since being admitted to the hospital, Des has unfortunately suffered two strokes; however, is slowly showing signs of improvement over time. He occasionally produces a cough and even twitches his thumb once in a while. I’ll continue to make updates as we hear more on my brother! It would mean so much to Des and our family if you can contribute whatever you can to Des’ medical expenses. Please continue to send positive energy into the universe and keep Des in your prayers for a speedy recovery. All we can do is remain hopeful and leave it with God’s will. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and think about Desmond and our family.

El cancer volvio hace aroximadamente dos años, ella estuvo en tratamiento con quimioterapias pero desafortunadamente no funciono, incluso hicimos una campana como esta ara recaudar fondos y poder pagar parte de las facturas medicas, gracias a ustedes se logro la meta que entonces nos propusimos Hoy Cristina quiere continuar en la lucha viendo otras alternativas.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-milena-beat-cancer,Help Milena beat cancer," *Tekst na srpskom je ispod engleskog*It is in the spirit of our religion to hope, to believe and to stand through all temptations with bravery and dignity. Sometimes a man must stop and ask himself how little is actually enough for each person to be happy. Sometimes, it means just to be healthy, to be close to our family, to share with them all nice things, to love each other and to support in hard times. Milena is a wife, and a mother of two healthy baby girls born in April of this year. Milena’s path to become a mother was not easy. After battling one malignancy her wish and strength to expand family with her husband MD Olja Bezbradica was stronger than all temptations. But, sometimes all strength and positive attitude is still not enough to cope with our life challenges. In 2017. Milena successfully finished her breast carcinoma treatment. After initial surgery she had chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Regular follow up showed that all findings were normal. After 2-3 years of her finishing her breast cancer treatment, with the consent of her oncologist, preparations for IVF were made. In October of 2020, in the clinic in Prague, transfer of the two embryos were made. Not long after, it was confirmed that Milena and Olja are expecting twins. Right after the transfer, first difficulties occurred. Her stomach started swelling, she was nauseous, started vomiting and started loosing weight. Due to her deteriorating condition, on the 04.12.2020 Milena had a surgery. Her ovaries were removed as well as part of her bowels. Terminal ileostomy was made. This time, Milena was diagnosed with colon cancer that had infiltrated peritoneum and right ovary. Taking into consideration Milena’s wish to keep the pregnancy and the consilium respected her decision. This brave mother received five cycles of chemotherapy. All while pregnant. In 33. week of pregnancy Milena had to have Caesarian section. Luckily, on the 28. of April, 2021. two beautiful and healthy baby girls were born. After giving birth Milena had to fight for her life. She continued her chemotherapy treatment supported by Avastin. Unfortunately, this medicine family has to buy because health insurance does not cover that additional medication. Avastin is the medication that keeps her illness stable and can significantly help the efficacy of the therapy she has been receiving. Official medical treatment protocols include only cytostatic therapy, without biological therapy or immunotherapy. This radically decreases perchance for the success of her treatment. Unfortunately, further therapies are possible within study or research centers that offer personalized oncological treatment in clinical studies. Among them is immunotherapy that has to be applied abroad. It is necessary to cover part of the hospital and treatment expenses. The family has no such financial possibilities. Good news is that detailed genetic and immunohistochemically analysis of the tumor tissue, which was performed in a very advanced laboratory in Germany (Tubingen), showed that immunotherapy is a possible way of further treatment. Unfortunately, it is not available in our country. Confronted with very difficult diagnosis and prognosis, the family, and Milena herself, find strength and motivation to keep going and feel joy in every beautiful day that they spend with their two girls. Now they need support from all of us to try to win the battle against this horrible disease. We need to help Milena so these beautiful baby girls can have a happy childhood in their mother’s embrace. Let’s help this young and brave mother and wife to continue giving love to her little girls for many years to come. To give them love that only a mother can give .We are humbly asking for your donation, according to your possibilities. Help us turn this simple wish of happiness from the beginning of the text into our reality. U duhu naše vere je da se nadamo, da verujemo i da sva iskušenja izdržimo hrabro i dostojanstveno. Nekad čovek zastane i zapita se koliko je zaista malo potrebno svakom čoveku da bi bio srećan. Nekad samo da smo zdravo i da smo blizu porodice (i sa njima da delimo sve lepo, da se volimo, ali i da se podržavamo u teškim periodima). Milena je supruga i majka dve zdrave devojčice rođene aprila ove godine. Milena nije imala lak put do svog potomstva, njena želja i snaga da nakon pobeđene jedne maligne bolesti nastoji da sa svojim suprugom dr Oljom Bezbradicom prošire svoju porodicu je bila jača od svih iskušenja. Nekada je sva snaga i pozitivan stav ipak nedovoljno da se izborimo sa svim životnim izazovima. Naime Milena je 2017. godine uspešno završila lečenje karcinoma dojke, nakon operacije primala je hemioterapiju i radioterapiju. Na redovnim kontrolama svi nalazi su bili uredni. Genetskim testiranjem utvrđena je BRCA 2 pozitivnost. Nakon 2-3 godine od završetka lečenja, uz saglasnost onkologa, započete su pripreme za vantelesnu oplodnju. Oktobra 2020. godine urađen je transfer dva embriona u Klinici u Pragu, nedugo zatim potvrđena je blizanačka trudnoća. Odmah nakon transfera pojavile su se prve tegobe u vidu oticanja stomaka, mučnine, povraćanja, tečnih stolica i gubitka u telesnoj težini. Zbog pogoršanja stanja učinjena je operacija kod Milene 04.12.2020.godine kada su odstranjeni jajnici, deo creva (stavljena je terminalna ileostoma). Po dobijanju patohistološkog nalaza Mileni je dijagnostikovan karcinom debelog creva koji je zahvatio trbušnu maramicu i desni jajnik. Nakon odluke Konzilijuma i uz Mileninu želju da se trudnoća zadrži, lečenje je nastavljeno tokom trudnoće primenom pet ciklusa hemioterapije. Dana 28.04.2021. godine urađen je carski rez, rođene su dve zdrave devojčice u 33-oj nedelji trudnoće. Nakon porođaja je nastavila hemioterapiju uz primenu Avastina koji porodica kupuje jer zdravstveno osiguranje ne pokriva taj dodatni lek koji može da drži bolest stabilnom i da značajno pomogne u efikasnosti terapije. Zvanični protokoli lečenja kod Milene podrazumevaju samo lečenje citostaticima, bez biološke I imunoterapije, što znatno umanjuje šanse da se lečenje završi uspešno. Dalje terapije su moguće u okviru studijskih i istraživačkih centara koji nude primenu personalizovane onkološke terapije u kliničkim studijama, između ostalog i imunoterapije u inostranstvu, ali je neophodno pokriti deo troškova lečenja u bolnici u inostranstvu, zašta porodica nema finasijske mogućnosti. Urađena je detaljna genska i imunohistohemijska analiza tkiva tumora u naprednoj laboratoriji u Nemačkoj (Tubingen) koja je pokazala da je imunoterapija mogući način daljeg lečenja, ali još uvek nije dostupna u našoj zemlji. Suočeni sa teškom dijagnozom i prognozom, porodica i sama Milena u sebi nalaze snage i motiva da idu dalje i da se raduju svakom lepom danu provedenom uz svoje dve devojčice. Sada im je potrebna podrška svih nas da probaju i da pobede opaku bolest i da svojoj porodici i devojčicama omoguće srećno detinjstvo u majčinom zagrljaju. Pomozimo ovoj hrabroj i mladoj majci I supruzi da, uz Božiju pomoć, još mnogo godina pruža svojim dvema devojčicama ljubav koju samo majka može da da. Molimo Vas da svako prema svojim mogućnostima pomogne da se jednostavna želja o sreći, sa početka ovog teksta, pretoči u stvarnost. ",9205,100000,4 days

Gary has been at UPS for 33 years and is well-known and loved by everyone on his Keweenaw County delivery route.  Leaving UPS will be hard for Gary because he is such a social person, and also because he will have to lose his income while undergoing treatment.

I am a single mom and currently have no income while I stay here in ICU with Dax as he continues to fight for his life. His dad has also been able to take off work so he can be here with Dax. Right now Dax is hour by hour and has turned for the worst. Anything helps during this time that we stay here to support our son while he fights for his life. Easton (older sibling), Dax, and I have been living in Columbus at the RMH since the beginning of September while he did intense pulmonary rehab. We are 2.5 hours away from home but continue to have bills that have to be paid on top of extra finances while living so far away from home. Anything and everything would help our family right now so that we can put our focus and energy on helping Dax fight for his life. DAXTON’S STORY At 10 months old Daxton was diagnosed with a very aggressive rare brain tumor. He underwent two brain surgeries where they were able to get 45% of his tumor. In 2018 and 2019 Daxton went through 5 rounds of chemotherapy and then 3 stem cell transplants. He had several surgeries, infections he had to battle, sickness, pain, tests, and admissions. You can learn more about his cancer journey on his Facebook page. Daxton surfers from panhypopituitarism secondary to his tumor. This is where his pituitary gland has stopped producing all hormones in his body due to damage from his tumor. He is treated for hypothyroidism, diabetes insipidus, adrenal insufficiency, no growth hormone production. He has hearing loss in both ears from chemotherapy. He is gtube dependent and suffers from sensory disorder and an oral aversion. In March of 2021 Dax was diagnosed with Interstial Lung disease and spent 10 days on a ventilator and had a lung biopsy to try and get a better diagnosis. With no luck he was sent home on oxygen and follow up care outpatient from Columbus Ohio, 2.5 hours away from home. Dax made several trips back and forth and many admissions trying to get better control of his lungs. In September Easton (big brother), Dax, and I moved into the RMH for what was going to be 6-8 weeks, so that Dax could do intensive pulmonary rehab outpatient. On September 18,2021 Dax was admitted to nationwide children’s hospital and was intubated and put onto a ventilator in hopes of giving his lungs time to rest and heal while doctors tried to figure out how to help maintain inflammation in his lungs. Daxton is still fighting for his life and has currently turned for the worst. We as a family are living hour by hour praying Daxton’s body can heal and make it through this current illness. He is still ventilated and has a small air leak in his lung that is causing his body to fill up with air putting pressure and stress on other organs in his body. The ICU team is trying their best to maintain Daxton’s current status but there isn’t much they can do but wait.  If you would like to get updates regularly Dax does have a Facebook page where I try to keep everyone as updated as possible while things are changing everyday. Please continue to lift our warrior up in prayer. ♥️ ",18043,20000,12-Oct-21

We set up this Go Fund Me page because we love Parker and the entire clan of Eisinger and Montgomery families.  As you may know, Parker was recently diagnosed with aggressive Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and on top of it mono. He has a big fight ahead of him. When I learned of this diagnosis I was desperate for some way to help him and his family out. I quickly realized there are so many people out there who also felt the same need to help this amazing family. We understand this path for Parker is paved with unknowns so Marissa, Brent and Lacy may not know exactly what they need from all of us right now, but we want to be proactive. Even with good health insurance, medical bills can pile up and the possible reduction in wages for Marissa and Brent during Parker’s treatments could cause added stress to this situation. Our hope is to collect funds that can help take any financial burdens off Brent and Marissa's plate so their sole focus can be on taking care of Parker and his younger sister’s. Battling Cancer can be unpredictable and their needs may change at a moments notice. Having this fund to draw from can reassure that finances will not have to be a concern at any point along this journey. If you also would like to help Parker and his clan, I encourage you to donate here. Please visit his Caring Bridge site for more details and updates... A CaringBridge Site was created for Parker.

Cách đây vài tháng, em ấy thấy bụng khó tiêu và thường bị ói. Ban đầu em ấy tưởng là bệnh bao tử tái phát và đến khám ở Bác sỹ tiêu hoá. Sau mấy lần dùng thuốc mà các triệu chứng vẫn không giảm, bác sỹ làm thêm các xét nghiệm và có chẩn đoán lâm sàng là bị ung thư gan vào ngày 8 tháng 9 năm 2021. Sau đó bác sỹ có chỉ định làm thêm các xét nghiệm sàng lọc và sinh thiết và đến nay đã khẳng định là Thiện bị ung thư giai đoạn 3 và cần điều trị ngay. Thiện là lao động duy nhất trong nhà nhưng hiện giờ tình hình sức khoẻ giảm sút và không thể làm việc được. Vợ của em ấy hiện giờ cũng phải dành hết thời gian để chăm sóc cho Thiện và hai con nhỏ mới được 3 tuổi và 5 tuổi. Thiện không có bất kì một người thân nào ở Mỹ cả. Bảo hiểm hiện tại của em ấy không chi trả cho chữa trị ung thư. Hiện giờ phần tiền tiết kiệm của gia đình đã chi trả hết cho những lần thăm khám vừa qua cộng với mấy lần phải vào phòng cấp cứu. Nguyện vọng của Thiện là muốn được về Việt Nam nhưng tình hình sức khoẻ của em ấy hiện nay không thể chịu được một chuyến bay dài như vậy. Bây giờ cần phải được điều trị ở đây để tình trạng sức khoẻ ổn hơn một chút mới có thể về Việt Nam được. Hiện giờ gia đình em ấy đang rất cần sự giúp đỡ của mọi người để có thể trang trải chi phí chữa bệnh trong thời gian tới đây, tiền vé máy bay về Việt Nam và chi phí chữa bệnh ở Việt Nam sau này.

Thien is a really nice person with a smile on his face. Several months ago, he started having some problem with the digestive system and then started vomiting more often. He thought that the stomach ache was coming back and started seeing a gastroenterologist. After several treatments, the symptoms have not improved and on Sep 08, 2021, the gastroenterologist had the initial diagnosis that he got liver cancer. Until now, he had done all the screening tests and biopsy and confirmed that he is now in stage 3 and immediate treatment is needed. He is the only worker in the family of four but with his current health status, he is not able to work any more. His wife currently needs to spend all her time taking care of him and the two little sons who are just 5 and 3 years old. He does not have any relatives in the US. His current insurance does not cover cancer. So far the medical expenses for all the tests and several times in the emergency room have consumed all of his family’s savings. He now wants to come back to Vietnam and continue the treatments over there but his current health situation is not good for that long flight. He needs some more treatments to help him reach stable health to travel. He needs help to cover the medical expenses over here, the flight tickets for the whole family to Vietnam and the future treatments in Vietnam. At the age of 33 and the father of two little sons, he still has a lot of things to do... And he cannot make it without your help. No donation is too small. Please consider helping if you are able to. ",147477,250000,13-Oct-21

Vanita rushed him to the Vanderbilt ER and after many scans in the early hours of the next morning, it was discovered that Joe had a brain tumor. Two days later it was surgically removed. In the coming weeks the tumor was discovered to be a grade 3 anaplastic oligodendroglioma and malignant. Now in late October, Joe has now started his 6 weeks of radiation to be followed by 6 months of chemotherapy, with treatment to proceed from there. As many of you know, Joe is a director and filmmaker and a beloved part of our freelance artist community here in Nashville. Being self-employed, he and Vanita fully pay for their insurance instead of accessing benefits others may have through their employers. Joe and Vanita's family and friends are asking for help in supporting them in whatever way possible, no matter how large or small. These funds raised here will help to pay their medical bills, insurance premiums and help with cost of living while Joe is going through treatment. A note from Joe --  ""Thank you all so much for the love and support that you have generously given through this last month already. Between visits, text messages, meals, gifts, donations and an overwhelming response to the t-shirt campaign that my dear friend Natalie set up (which has helped cover some medical costs already), Vanita and I have felt so surrounded through such a long and exhausting time. My oncologist encouraged us that this specific kind of tumor/brain cancer is known for long periods of inactivity. It most likely will come back, so we’re cleaning up as much as we can of it now and hoping for more discoveries and advancements by that time.

We are all still in disbelief of the incident that occurred on Saturday, August 7th, 2021, and what Chicago Police Officer Carlos Yanez, Jr., P.O. Joshua Blas, and his late partner P.O. Ella French endured. The physical harm done in addition to the psychological trauma everyone is experiencing should never have happened. During this incident, Carlos suffered from multiple gunshot wounds to the eye, brain, and shoulder all causing potentially lifelong disability. In turn, we suspect home modifications, accommodations, and transportation needs to increase accessibility and quality of life. He had so much of his face and eye socket fractured during this incident, but thankfully that has been surgically repaired. We remain hopeful for a miraculous recovery but have to prepare for what’s to come. We will always pray for the stability of the blood vessels of his brain. Most importantly, we remain with our hearts full of gratitude that he is in fact alive. Officer Carlos Yanez, Jr goes by many names. Carlos, Chuck, Junior, Nino, Yanez, Chico, Cheekaladinos. Anyone that knows Carlos, will say what an amazing human being he is. He is just so genuine. We all know him as a strong, hard-working and good-hearted soul. He was ALWAYS on the GO and ALWAYS willing to help family, friends and strangers alike. Carlos is a loving husband to Brenda and adoring Father to his almost 3 year old son CJ. As an officer he cared deeply for the district he served. He loved to do physical work, exercise, play with his son on his time off and he loved to dance. Once he hit the dance floor the party officially started. To see him with paralysis of 3 limbs and loss of an eye is unnatural and heart-breaking. We are hoping with extensive therapy, hard work, and prayers he will see a successful recovery to get back to what he loves. For many years Carlos always talked about how he wanted to live in Englewood. He always spoke of the children. Their innocence and how he wished he could bring some of them home. He said they deserved an environment free from so much gun violence, physical/sexual abuse, and neglect. He witnessed things he could never understand. But it never hardened him. He continued to take pride in getting guns off the streets and treating everyone he interacted with respect. He felt in his heart he was reducing gun violence and that is why he weathered the challenges of being a Chicago Police Officer in such a challenging district. This is such a huge blow to our entire family but to no one more than his wife, Brenda and his son, CJ. Carlos and Brenda are an amazing team and both carry very heavy loads for their family. CJ was born with Craniosynostosis. He has had multiple cranial surgeries and needs ongoing therapies. During Carlos’ time of recovery so much more will be on Brenda’s shoulders financially, physically, and emotionally. We created this GoFundMe page because we want to support Officer Carlos’ family from all angles. Many have reached out asking how they can lighten the load and the support has been overwhelmingly heartfelt and appreciated. Which is why we are setting up official modalities for donations. Our hearts continue to be with Officer French’s and Officer Blas’ family and everyone impacted during these difficult times. We thank the dispatcher, Keith J. Thornton for his heroic and calm response and EVERYONE who assisted with the events that occurred that night.This GoFundMe account is organized by Nicole Yanez (Sister) and Evelyn Gamboa (Sister-in-Law).

https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-first-time-mother-fight-breast-cancer,Please help first time mother fight breast cancer," Mirna was eight months pregnant when she learned of her cancer diagnosis. She had to deliver her baby immediately after the doctors discovered that she had Stage III Breast Cancer. The type of cancer she has developed is a very fast acting but treatable cancer, called Her2Positive. She is under the care of UCLA Medical Group and world renowned oncologist, Dr. John Glaspy. Mirna has had yearly mammograms since reaching the age of 40. Last May of 2020 was like every other, in that she went for her mammogram and the results were negative but showing breast density (a very common outcome). This March 2021, she felt a lump in one of her breasts and immediately informed her OBGYN. The doctor told her it was most likely mastitis (inflamed breast tissue and/or clogged milk ducts). For the next three months, the lump grew larger and larger. Every time she contacted her OBGYN, she was reassured it was mastitis. Finally, in June 2021 Mirna had a scheduled appointment with her OBGYN and this time she complained of the pain this so called mastitis was causing. She could feel aches, tenderness, heat radiating from her breasts and even the look of her nipple had changed. During this appointment, Mirna’s doctor now realized the severity of the situation and also thought that Mirna was in risk of preeclampsia. She immediately sent her to the Labor and Delivery unit where they performed an ultrasound to examine the breast. Just two hours later, three doctors informed Mirna that she needed and biopsy right at that very moment. The next day after leaving the hospital, Mirna was informed that she had Stage III Breast Cancer and was told that they will immediately have to deliver the baby because she needed to start treatment as soon as possible. There was no time to wait. A baby needs his mother to be well. Little did she know that she was going to be fighting her biggest battle to date. Mirna has kept a positive attitude from the onset of her diagnosis and with every chemo treatment, even though her symptoms have been very difficult to bare at times. She is in love with her newborn, Leo and finds joy in her day just watching him thrive, laugh and grow. She is determined to fight and beat this awful disease and is looking forward to fully healing so she can continue to be the best mom to Leo and create wonderful memories with him. I ask that you consider donating to Mirna, so we can help her not only pay for her upcoming hospital bills and treatments, but so she can continue to provide for Leo at this difficult time where costs keep adding up on a daily basis. Mirna works as a make-up artist/hair stylist in the entertainment industry where it is standard to only be provided with insurance if she meets the hourly requirements. Work for her was put to a halt at the beginning of the pandemic, as all production instantly stopped. Now, she is unable to work but she has been able to collect disability and keep her insurance for an extended time. However, this benefit will expire come January 1, 2022. This will put an immense hardship on her and her ability to continue treatment at the same hospital, with her same oncologist, not to mention the hardship of providing for the well being of her newborn son. If any one of you have the privilege to know Mirna, you would know that she has a very big heart and would do anything she could to help others, including animals. It’s always been in her nature. Please help take this burden off of her. No donation is too small. Your kindness and generosity will help take the focus off of her financial stress and put the focus on getting better. Thank you all for your consideration. From all of us who love our dear friend Mirna. ",10210,100000,1 day

Arya was a bit of a miracle baby from the very start - born on May 27 2021, almost 6 weeks early. Arya is a little warrior and has been so sweet, strong, and smiley - melting the hearts of everyone that meets her. She has heart issues that will need to be monitored throughout her childhood, along with kidney reflux, and she was just admitted into the Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg FL with meningitis and salmonella (which have also triggered seizures in her tiny body). This is over an hour from their home and the doctors are estimating that Arya will be in the hospital for a minimum of 30 days. Deb had just started back to work after maternity leave and is worried about losing her job, income, and the family's benefits while staying at Arya's side in the hospital.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-heather-with-her-battle-against-cancer,Help Heather With Her Battle Against Cancer," This story is being shared with Heather and the Oman family’s awareness and consent. In 2020, pregnant with her first child, Heather discovered a lump in her breast. At 6 weeks postpartum, Heather raised her concerns to her obstetrician and was given a script to get an ultrasound. Heather got the ultrasound on November 25, 2020, and spent the 5 months after being told by multiple Doctors that she had nothing to worry about. The lump, and associated symptoms, was attributed to things like infection and hormone changes, and Heather was consistently told to wait another 2-3 months and then come back. By the end of this 5-month runaround, Heather was experiencing more broad and worrying symptoms, such as blurry vision and dizzy spells. At this point, Heather saw another new Doctor, who did another ultrasound and, upon seeing the ultrasound, immediately referred Heather to a surgeon. When Heather saw the surgeon the following day she received multiple tests, including a biopsy, mammogram, and 3D mammogram. Three lumps were found in Heather’s breast. On March 29, 2021, just three months before her 30th birthday, Heather got the call that the three tumors in her breast tissue that were biopsied were malignant, with the largest tumor estimated at 8cm. For those who are wondering how big an 8cm tumor is, that is about the size of a peach. Heather was diagnosed with Angiosarcoma , an extremely rare type of cancer that effects about 1 in 1 million people. On April 26, 2021, Heather began chemotherapy. Heather completed six rounds of intense chemotherapy between April and August, receiving the strongest chemotherapy drug available via a port in her chest. Heather was also hospitalized multiple times during the course of her chemotherapy, for things like neutropenia and low counts of hemoglobin and platelets, requiring overnight hospital stays and blood transfusions. The first of these hospital stays took place in the week before Mother’s Day, and almost resulted in Heather spending Mother’s Day in the hospital. Luckily, Heather was discharged from the hospital the night of Mother’s Day, and was able to spend the final hours of her first Mother’s Day with her husband and son. A month after completing chemotherapy, and finding that the tumor had shrunk at the time of completion, Heather had a mastectomy. The pathology from the surgery revealed that the tumor had grown a substantial amount in the one month since ending chemotherapy, going from 1cm post-chemotherapy to 6.5cm at the time of surgery. The surgeons were able to remove all of the cancer, but with only 2mm of clean margins (which is about the width of two strands of hair.) Due to the aggressive nature of this particular cancer, Heather’s oncology team agreed that further treatment is needed to prevent reoccurrence in the near or distant future. Heather started radiation treatment on October 26, 2021, which consists of treatment 5 days a week until 30 sessions are completed. Heather will also receive scans at least once a year, for the rest of her life. Throughout all of this, Heather has had her newly 1-year-old son, Caiden, home with her, as the family could not risk the exposure of Caiden being in daycare and potentially getting Heather sick. Heather’s family, friends, and husband have rallied behind her to help her care for her son so she can continue to heal and fight. The funds raised through this page will go directly to Heather and her family, and will help them pay for everything from medical bills to diapers and groceries. Due to the duration and severity of Heather's illness and treatments, her and her family are experiencing a reduction in earnings and need our support. We ask that you please donate anything that you are able to help Heather and her family through this incredibly challenging time.

A group of us who care about our friend Clark Plaunt want to reach out to people who are close to him to help support his treatment and medical bills for this sudden medical emergency. Unfortunately, Clark fell ill with what was thought to be a cold and developed into pneumonia. He went to urgent care to get a chest X-ray and was told to go to the hospital. After reaching the hospital they discovered that there was a complete blockage of his left bronchial passage. He then waited two days to be transferred by ambulance to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. After testing at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, their current thought process is possible Carcinoid Lung Cancer and may have to remove part of his left lung due to complications from the blockage. Update 10-27: Procedure went well to remove and get air flowing to his left lung, but unfortunately he will require more procedures next week, moving in a good direction but still more work to go. Thank you everyone for the continued support Clark has been one of my close friends for a few years now and I know he'd do anything to help anyone in a situation like this.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/for-dave-johnson-family,For Dave Johnson & Family," My bother, Dave Johnson, was diagnosed with a genetic heart condition called HCM in 1998. In August of 2015 he received a total artificial heart to sustain him until a donor heart became available for transplant. In May of 2016 Dave received a heart transplant and battled rejection off and on the first few years but in 2018 the rejection seemed to be under control. However, on September 28th of this year he was admitted to Stanford Medical with an accelerated heart rate and low blood pressure. The first two weeks they were trying to figure out why he was feeling so bad. Come to find out he had a rare form of rejection that isn't usually tested for, it seems this has been brewing for a while. Dave had been gaining weight and having less and less energy. He had been seeing his doctors in PA, but nothing came of that. He started seeing the doctors at Stanford, and they were working to get the fluid off of him. He had been carrying around 40 pounds of water weight that previous doctors had told him was fat. Dave went for an ablation on October 13th and his heart went into a bad rhythm that did not perfuse his other organs well at all. October 14th Dave was in full cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure (This just means his heart was not working, and therefore he also went into kidney and liver failure.) They inserted a device called an intra-aortic balloon pump and a semi permanent pacemaker to try and help his heart pump enough blood to his organs. October 15th, it became obvious that Dave was continuing to go downhill, his family had to decide on end of life care, or a machine called ECMO till Dave could get a heart/ possible heart & kidney transplant. So they put him on an ECMO machine (this machine was doing the job of his heart and his lungs for him). Dave responded very well to the ECMO and they were able to start treating the heart rejection on October 16th. As of October 24th, Dave was still on ECMO but his liver appeared to have completely bounced back. He no longer has the intra aortic balloon pump. He has completed most of the heart rejection treatment and his heart is responding but the big question was how much was the heart damaged while this rejection was happening. Currently, as of Oct. 27th doctors have determined that Dave will need a heart and kidney transplant and plan to list him as early as Friday Oct 29th for the heart & kidney transplant. After being listed for transplant Dave must live in the hospital on ECMO until transplanted. Additionally, they learned that after transplant they must live within 30 minutes of the hospital for three months which means they will need to temporarily relocate. Dave will also require a caregiver from the family that is available 24/7 during those three months. Meanwhile, Christie (his wife), started a new job in August and they moved permanently to California at the end of July. As such she does not qualify for FMLA, does not have sick leave or vacation time saved up, and hasn’t been able to work the last 3 weeks. The funds raised will go toward medical bills, housing, transportation purposes, and necessities such as food and caregiver expenses. Any amount that you are able to donate will be greatly appreciated. ",13121,22000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/jon-aquinos-road-to-recovery,Jon Aquino's Road to Recovery,"Team fundraiserMaria Giangiulio and 0 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Kay Aquino. On August 25, 2021, COVID nurse, husband and father, Jon Aquino, was airlifted to Cooper hospital with a high fever while vacationing with his family at the Jersey shore.  Jon was diagnosed with strep meningitis that had led to septic shock. He had a brain bleed, was in liver and kidney failure, and had to be intubated and sedated. On September 2, Jon regained consciousness, but his journey was not over. As a result of the sepsis, BOTH of his hands AND feet had turned black and needed to be amputated.  On September 18th, Jon underwent surgery to have his hands amputated. Just four days later, he was back in surgery to have his feet amputated.   Presently, Jon’s acute kidney failure persists, though doctors are confident they will heal in time. As a quadruple amputee, Jon now faces innumerable hurdles.Prior to his illness, Jon had been working as a nurse at Jefferson Stratford Hospital in New Jersey.   In March 2020, Jon’s unit became a COVID unit. Jon directly cared for COVID patients, and for months would come home after work, change in the garage, bleach wipe his clothes, put his clothes directly into the washer, and then shower before hugging his young daughter and then-pregnant wife Kay, who is also a registered nurse (they met in nursing school).According to his coworkers, “Jon is an incredible nurse who is admired by all his peers, always puts his patients first, and always looks out for everyone on the floor.”  Jon was nominated by his peers as a March of Dimes Nurse of the Year in 2015. He then became nurse manager of the same unit later in 2015. This year, Jon was nominated for the Beth Petrakis award for being an excellent teammate who gives great care to his patients.Financial NeedThe Aquino’s face many challenges ahead.  As friends of the Aquino’s we are asking for $1,000,000 in financial support to help reach the following goals:1. Pay for hand replacement surgery:  Jon has the opportunity to have a life transformative hand replacement surgery by Dr. Levin of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the few doctors in the world that performs this cutting edge procedure.  Unfortunately, insurance companies do not cover this procedure so all costs would be out-of-pocket.  Please watch this video to learn more about this amazing opportunity: https://youtu.be/YhquPBYcTVQ2. Pay hospital bills:  Jon was airlifted to the nearest critical care hospital in August, and continues to be hospitalized. Medical bills are mounting.  Jon will of course need rehab, prosthetic legs, and many other medical services in the years ahead.  There is so much uncertainty at the moment about what will be covered by insurance, and if Jon will continue to be covered by insurance if he has to stop working.3. Retrofit the Aquino home to accommodate Jon’s disability:  many changes and modifications to the Aquino home will be required to support Jon, including but not limited to installing a larger shower to accommodate a wheelchair and/or caregiver (which will then require relocating the washer and dryer to the basement), building an entrance ramp to the home, installing voice-activated and other assistive technologies.4. Allow Kay and Jon at least two years to adjust to changes without worrying about having two incomes:  Kay will need to manage Jon’s care and continue the care of their two very young children (ages 4 years and 5 months). Obviously Jon cannot resume his work as a nurse at this time. Kay will be able to go back to work once Jon is moving along with his rehab but there is so much uncertainty revolving around if and when Jon will be able to work again. Due to physical limitations, Jon may need training and education in a new field or role when he is able to return to work down the road. 5. Provide mental health counseling for Jon, Kay, and the girls:  this is an enormous change for each member of the Aquino family that includes many devastating losses.  Each member would benefit from therapy to help process these changes and carve out a new path forward. Call to ActionWe know a million dollars is a big ask, AND we know of the generous spirit of so many of our fellow humans.  Let’s collectively give back to Jon who selflessly dedicated himself to his patients for so many years, most recently risking his life for his patients with severe COVID. Let’s give this family so much support that money is no longer one of their stressors and they can focus on healing and moving forward together.  Thank you in advance to everyone; all donations big and small make a difference! 100% of donations will go to the Aquino family. ",50890,1000000,2-Sep-21

In October, multiple cancers and blood clots were found in his body which was later confirmed to be a stage 4 metastatic cancer and has spread from his lungs to his brain.  Because of the cancer, he suffered a stroke and multiple brain bleeds. He was immediately seen by doctors and oncologists who suggested chemotherapy, radiation, as well as immunotherapy. This week, he suffered another small stroke which has inhibited the voluntary movements of his right arm and leg. We are told that there is a slight chance in extending his prognosis by these treatments. Marty has decided that he will fight this cancer. His friends and family are doing everything they can to be by his side to join him on this fight. They have shared duties in taking care of him, his health, finances, dogs, and house. Needless to say, Marty is now not able to return to work as a result. We are raising funds for Marty and family to help provide for his medical care and any other needs that arise in this coming year. Our hope is that this fundraiser is a way to relieve a small part of their burden during this time.

My little sister Monika is fighting her biggest fight of her life in the Intensive care unit. For those who don’t know my sister well, Monika is a senior at the University at Buffalo, where she is majoring in Psychology. Monika followed her dreams of playing Division I volleyball in the United States, beginning her career at Long Beach State before moving on to Buffalo where she has been the last three years, a place that she considers her home away from home. Unfortunately, just a few weeks ago, her dreams took a huge hit. Monika was admitted to the ICU at the beginning of August with an aggressive bacterial infection. Monika’s condition rapidly deteriorated as she turned septic, resulting in multi organ failure. Facing near death, a decision was made to perform a bilateral above the knee amputation, giving Monika the best chance at survival. The odds of this type of reaction and how quickly Monika’s body shut down are extremely rare. It's been five long weeks since Monika was admitted to the hospital, and in those five weeks she has had seven surgeries. For these five weeks, she has been fighting unbelievably hard to stay here with us. She has been through so much, too much for one person to endure in life. But she is a fighter, she has the full admiration not just from me but from the whole MICU unit. Her body may be weak and fragile but her mind and motivation to live is made of steel. Rehabilitation is the next step but before then she needs to recover from the illness. She continues to fight a bacterial infection in her blood, a fungus in her leg wound, and pneumonia in her lungs. Unable to eat on her own, she’s still using a feeding tube down her nose to the stomach. Monika is a continuing to improve each and every day. Being able to sit up in bed, sucking on an ice chip and being able to swallow water down her throat is massive progress. Things we take for granted are life changing moments for Monika. As an international student-athlete living overseas in the United States, Monika is still aiming to finish her Psychology degree while getting the best care possible here in the US. I will be staying by her side away from my home in Australia for the unforeseeable future, so in addition to funding Monika’s medical and rehabilitation procedures, the money raised through this GoFundMe page will also be used to help to support me as Monika’s primary caregiver. Every day is a step back into life away from hospital walls. Facing new challenges, understanding what the new normal is going to be like for her and looking for moments which bring us joy from being alive. From the bottom of our hearts, our family thanks everyone for their love and support of Monika!! ",135231,250000,7-Sep-21

We have seen a great decline in his health and mental status, and we want to provide him and his family some level of comfort during this difficult time. When you start to take difficult decisions of “What comes next”, the last thing a family needs to worry about is money. That’s where this “Gofundme” comes in for Surup at this time. We are making this pledge for Surup & his family to aid him with any future medical expenses. Our goal is to at least relieve Surup’s family from some of the financial burdens ahead. Let us extend all our hands to support our loving Surup and his family and keep him in our prayers. ",46891,360000,18-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/nh2f9s-help-us-bring-abbey-home,Help Us Bring Abbey Home," Hi, my name is Ashleigh and I am fundraising for medical recovery and rehabilitation costs for our sister Abbey. We need to get her to a facility back home in Michigan so we can be present and advocate for her as she heals. On Tuesday October 19th, we got a call that Abbey may have been in an accident. I spoke with the Sheriff in California who identified her by fingerprints and traced her back to Michigan. It was really confusing initially when everything occurred but since then we’ve been able to put together all the pieces. All we knew at that time is that she was medically stable and neurologically mostly unresponsive, nonverbal, and unable to follow commands. Right away we made arrangements to get out here and come see her and found ourselves on a plane within 12 hours of the call. On 9/20 Abbey was in a car accident. She was walking across the street at 4am and she was hit by a car in LA. Unfortunately, the car left the scene and the driver is not identified at this time. Abbey had no identification on her and had been a “Jane Doe” up until Tuesday night. For 4 weeks nobody knew her name, her history, or if she had anyone out there looking for her. After the accident, she was rushed to a higher level of care for extensive injuries and had to be intubated due to blunt trauma to the chest. Because she couldn’t be extubated quickly, they placed a tracheostomy and she is now breathing on her own through that. Because of the trach, she had to have a feeding tube placed (PEG tube) for nutrition. She also had hip and ankle fractures that are now healed after surgery. She suffered a severe brain bleed, hypoxic brain injury, and a skull fracture. Before we went to see her we knew she could open her eyes and sometimes “track” (follow an object with her eyes) but she was mostly not responsive and nonverbal. We were prepared for the worst. We landed in CA, got to our hotel and went to see her. Our visit with Abby was much more positive than we expected. She initially seemed to recognize us and as we showed her pictures and talked about our family she absolutely seemed to be responsive and interacting with us the best she could. And she could track really well! She’s not quite talking but she manages a few words, and purposefully moves her arms and legs. She grabbed our hands a few times and can sometimes squeeze. We got real hugs our last morning before we left. She blinks and smiles. She shook her head in agreement a few times and we even got her to laugh. It does seem like she comes in and out a little but she was very alert overall. Her care team assured us that she's made a ton of progress and they reordered services that a week ago she couldn’t even use- like occupational and physical therapy. We spoke with more of her care team and everyone was so happy to finally know her name, know she had family, and know that people cared about her. Everyone sounds cautiously optimistic but overall, they were encouraging. Her prognosis will only be known with time but everyone said to us that her young age will likely be in her favor and they are very hopeful she will be resilient and get through this. Her case worker is currently trying to place her in an outpatient facility in California. Our next flight to see her is November 3rd. Our goals are to secure private insurance for her here in Michigan, transfer her here so she can have advocates close by, find acute or subacute rehabilitation placement and obtain community resources for her recovery. The costs associated with her transport alone could be up to $7,000-$9,000 and after researching the lifetime recovery cost for a patient with a TBI, we found out it ranges anywhere from $83,000 to $3 million dollars. We have no idea what she is going to need or what she is going to qualify for, but we know that we have to get her home to her family. ",21655,20000,5 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/carsons-cancer-recovery,Carson's Cancer Recovery," Hi, I am Robin I am Carson's fiancee and the mom of our two amazing children. I am starting this because we have had a pretty rough year. Carson was diagnosed with cancer last year. It started with a tumor growing on the side of his neck, at first the doctors thought it could possibly be an infection and gave him some antibiotics and ordered some imaging. After they got that back and noticed how quickly his mass was growing they decided he needed to get a biopsy. December 29th, 2020 we got the finalized report from UW that he had a form of melanoma, which we were a little confused by as he had no source on the outside of his body. After a larger biopsy, we learned the type he has is called B.R.A.F positive metastatic melanoma. They explained that's why the tumor in his neck had grown from the size of a golf ball to the size of a grapefruit in only 2 months and our next step was scheduling surgery. Carson had his surgery in January of 2021, for the most part, everything went very well. They ended up taking out 37 of his lymph nodes and pretty much all of the surrounding tissue, they tried to take a large flap graph out of the left thigh but were not able to make it work so they ended up having to cut open his right leg as well to get tissue to transplant into his neck. 8 days in the hospital but he was in high spirits joking around with all his nurses and walking miles around the nursing station every day he was there bound and determined to show everyone he was ready to go home. this was so much for his body to go through but he took it like a champ and was ready to get it over with! he was at home healing on FLMA for just over 2 months. After all of this things seemed to be going really well, his body was responding to the immunotherapy medication without complications and he was back to work later this year in March. In July he developed a really nasty infection in one of his surgical sites, it kind of stumped his doctors and us as to why it would all of a sudden get infected when all he did was accidentally bump it on a table at work. This infection lasted about a month and a half and he was on some very strong antibiotics and just would not go away. Carson was seen in the urgent care and ER and then finally when we had made an appointment to the cancer center to have it looked at more thoroughly and it finally started to heal. A couple of weeks later in the first week of August, Carson was at work when he started getting tunnel vision and walked into a wall. He knew something was off and walked down to the ER to get it checked out. After a CT scan of his brain, it showed he had some significant swelling in his brain and 1 large tumor in the back of his head, and 2 smaller tumors in the center. The few leftover cancer cells in his body had made their way up to his brain and started growing. After consulting with the oncologist at providence medical center, they decided a good course of treatment would be steroids to help with the swelling in his brain and  SRS Laser Therapy ( This is a concentrated radiation laser). He goes in 3 times over the course of a week and they hit the smaller ones a couple of times but each day they really try going after the larger tumor. This time around he was off work for 3 weeks and came back on light duty for a couple of weeks after, while his brain is trying to heal from the SRS procedure. Over these few weeks Carson is slowly tapering down off the steroids and his one-month check-up from his procedure is coming up. After this doctor's visit, we find out he still has some swelling in his brain and also bleeding coming from the large tumor in the back of his head. The doctors are not sure how long the bleeding has been going on or even if it's still happening so they tell us to just watch his cognitive functions carefully and to come into the ER if he has any bad headaches. A week later he was in the ER from a bad headache. They find more swelling and see that the largest tumor is actively bleeding and it needs to be taken care of right away. He gets transferred to the UW campus where he had his first surgery and after some more CT scans his oncology team thinks its best for them to go ahead and take out the big tumor in the back of his head as it is still actively bleeding and causing a large amount of swelling and fluid build-up in his brain. He has his second surgery at the end of September. He's back on high doses of steroids and not feeling good at all. The oncology team working with him really wants him back on immunotherapy but now decided that the therapeutic dose isn't enough to kill the cancer in his body and he starts his first IV therapy on October 1st. For the most part, Carson was doing ok after his second surgery, then about a week after he was really sleepy and couldn't get out of bed, and didn't want to eat. I knew something was wrong and called his doctor. We went to his oncologist's office the next day and had another CT scan. More bad news the other smaller tumors were now causing large amounts of swelling in his brain and were starting to act like the larger one they just took out. At this point, I'm not understanding why they didn't take them out in the first place, after speaking with his surgeons we find out that the area these tumors are in can not be operated on like the first one. So what do we do now? Carsons surgeons let us know he will be going back into surgery again for another procedure called a thermoknife. They make quite a few incisions and go in with very small needles to the area of his brain the tumors are in and cauterize the tumor and surrounding area. This was just a little over a week ago on October 19th, 2021 Carson has been off work since Sept 20th, exhausted all of his PTO and we are still waiting on WA state leave and FMLA paperwork to be finished and processed on their end. He has already gone through most of his short-term disability with his first surgery and now is on his 3rd surgery and needing to be home to rest. This has been such a hard time for our family and now we are starting to get really worried about finances with him being out of work for so long. We started this because we know that there is a possibility that he may not even get any STD pay until he is back to work. (it has happened with some fellow coworkers already) What he might be getting probably won't be very much as he has had to be off work for so long on and off throughout this year. On top of everything he now has medical bills stacking up that are clear over 20k. We figured with the first surgery we would be able to take care of it on our own but with all of the imaging, appointments, multiple trips to Seattle for treatment, and surgeries there is no way for us to get caught up right now. Also if you know of some charities that provide assistance please message me! It would be very much appreciated. These funds would mean the world to us right now and would help us cover our monthly bills and food, childcare as Carson is not really able to help out and has multiple weekly appointments in Seattle, and medical costs while Carson is at home healing and trying to get better. We honestly don't know if this is the last treatment or procedure he is going to have to go through. He will be doing IV immunotherapy for the next year at least and then more follow up after that just to make sure they got all the cancer out of his body. This could be a couple of years of treatment for him. We hope not but it's still a possibility. Carson is such an amazing person, a great father, and spouse, and the only thing he wants right now is to feel better so that he is able to get back to work and be able to spend time and do things with our children. He has helped so many people, gone out of his way even broken his truck a couple of times to try to help others. He has helped friends, neighbors, and people he doesn't know. It is just the type of person he is. Since we have been together, I have seen him help people paint their houses, install flooring, fix cars, move just about anything you can think of. If someone is asking for help, Carson is the first person to raise his hand and say, ""no problem! I will be there and help you any way I can!"" Carson has been through so much this year and all we really want is him to be able to heal at home comfortably. There is no way to prepare for what he has had to go through. Our family has struggled so much with this and we have been doing the best we can. We appreciate you taking the time to read about what has happened and any help anyone can give us. If you are able to share his story, donate or send any thoughts and prayers our way. Thank you so much!  The Anderson Family ",9330,20000,3 days

On Sept 16th 2021, Sergio was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer with metastasis in liver and ribs. The medical team advised to start imunotherapy as soon as possible.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-lukes-heart,Support for Luke F and family.," Hi everyone, my name is Shelby, I started this fundraiser to help my partner Luke. We normally would never be so public about personal things, but in our current situation we can use all the help we can get. Let it be prayers, good energy, or a few dollars, a little bit of help from our community can go a long way. Mid October Luke went to the hospital and was diagnosed with acute systolic congestive heart failure, with bi ventricular muscle failure. This classifies him in severe heart failure. After spending a week in the hospital, which included a stroke, he was discharged with many unanswered questions. We are currently in the process of stabilizing his heart through an assortment of medicines. At the moment it is unclear whether the heart failure was caused by a virus or genetics and will remain unclear without further testing. If medicine can't recover his heart, Luke will more than likely be on a heart transplant list at the age of 31. This unforeseen life change has and will continue to challenge our little family. Our financial challenges have just started and are going to continue to grow. Even with health insurance, navigating the system has proven difficult. Many of the procedures, visits, and tests may not all be covered. Luke will also not be able to fully work for a bit. Les Brown once said ""Ask for help, not because you are weak, but because you want to remain strong."" With how drastically our lives changed over night, we learn that it never hurts to ask for help. Absolutely everything and anything is appreciated, from the bottom of our hearts. ",11290,30000,2 days

Brenda Levin has been one of Philadelphia’s most beloved holistic healers, specializing in acupuncture, massage, Chinese herbal medicine and nutrition counseling for oncology patients. But in a stunning twist of irony, Brenda’s experiences were also a preparation for her own cancer journey. In March of 2017, as her 40th birthday was approaching, Brenda was diagnosed with stage four metastatic breast cancer – a grim prognosis which typically means 1 year to live. Yet Brenda made it through the first year. And then the second year. And then the third year, with her present and energetic spirit keeping us all laughing and optimistic. But 2021 has brought upon new challenges. The cancer has begun to spread, which led to her mastectomy in March of this year. And now it is with most heavy hearts we share her latest diagnosis and this call for support. After a recent brain MRI and full body CT scan, the tests now show the cancer has spread to Brenda’s abdomen, her lungs and the dura lining of her brain, known as 'leptomeningeal carcinomatosis"". Without treatment oncologists estimate a 2 months life expectancy. However with treatment, we are hopeful the proper care can extend her life up to 12 months. Brenda has immediately begun 10 sessions of Whole Brain Radiation (WBR) as of Sept 1st and will start chemotherapy Abraxane and Carboplatin on the September 16. This is an intense and aggressive treatment plan supplemented with various holistic treatments not covered by insurance, including  massage, acupuncture, PEMF treatments, psychological appointments, and overall mental health and wellness care. Brenda can no longer work, and she has begun to get her affairs in order. The coming months will be overwhelming mentally, emotionally and physically, but we can help her financially. Please join us in supporting Brenda by funding  her many end of life costs and treatments. This will help provide Brenda the opportunity to best enjoy her life as comfortably as possible and to make every moment with us count. ",75001,75000,9-Sep-21

Krista had a seizure while attending a wedding in Helena on October 23rd. Extensive testing at the hospital in Helena revealed a mass on her brain. She was stablized and returned back home to Great Falls. On Tuesday October 26th Krista met with a neurosurgeon and was given an MRI. The MRI has revealed a fairly large tumor that grows very near the part of her brain that controls motor skills and speech. Doctors in Montana and in Seattle, WA agree that the tumor needs to be removed as soon as possible, before it reaches the motor cortex of her brain. If it were to reach that part of her brain it could not be removed, and she would likely lose her speech and motor skills. The origin of the tumor and follow up care cannot be determined until it is removed and biopsied. Krista has a long road ahead of her which could include weeks of rehab. She has no medical insurance which further exacerbates this horrible situation. Krista, her husband Cody, her parents- Charlie and Kathie, and her brother and nephew- Justin and Darius- will be going to Harborview in Seattle because this surgery cannot be done here in Montana. They will leave Tuesday November 2nd and Krista will have surgery Friday November 5th. They will be in Seattle at least 8 days. This Go Fund Me is to help Krista and her family with travel expenses and hotel stays. Any money raised above that will go toward her medical bills. We welcome everybody’s prayers and positive thoughts, but we do ask that you respect Krista in this difficult time, by not reaching out to her yet, as she needs time to process her situation. Krista has always taken on the care-taker role in any situation she has encountered in her life, and is always the first to volunteer to help someone who is in need of any sort of support. She goes out of her way to make sure each and every person she crosses paths with, feels loved and cared about.

Unfortunately, Bill’s throat cancer has made an uninvited return, this time in his vocal cords, and is growing aggressively. We (his family) are putting together this campaign to raise funds to support Bill during his cancer treatment and recovery, so he can rest easy before getting back to work doing what he loves (taking photos!). Because the tumor was dangerously restricting his airway, he had an emergency procedure on October 19 to put in a tracheal tube in his neck which required an unexpected three-day stay in the hospital. He will be undergoing chemotherapy to hopefully shrink the tumor, and may need surgery afterwards to remove it completely. Currently, he is not able to talk and we are unsure if or when he will get his voice back. Over the next 6 - 8 months, Bill will be unable to work and will need financial support to keep his business from disappearing. Your donations will make sure that Bill can keep up on rent for his studio and apartment, medical bills, car and insurance payments, bills, and day-to-day expenses. Anyone who knows Bill knows that he would rather be creating and giving than receiving help.

We decided to do IVF. I did 4 treatments of IVF. Injecting and dosing my body full of hormones. Not having a clue of the CANCER dangers.  Finally,  October 1st 2015 from the 4th treatment I got pregnant.  It was a very bad pregnancy for me! I felt horrible everyday. Something was off. February 14th Valentine’s Day 2016  My face hands and feet stared swelling. My sister said stop at cvs and check you leave pressures. I stopped and my pressures were off the charts. I had know idea what pressures were. I had never had any health problems.  The pharmacist said go to Publix theirs pressure machine is calibrated. I drove down the street and checked. I told the pharmacist the pressure and that I was 6 months pregnant.  He immediately said call your doctor now. I called and my doctor told me to get up to the hospital ASAP. They would be waiting. I got checked in and the when I got there the doctors told me I was very very sick woman. I was transferred to ladies and babies of Tampa. I had severe preeclampsia and I didn’t know but the doctor told me I almost died. The next day , we had lost our little baby Garnet Anne Disney at 6 months of being pregnant. I gave birth to her and held her little 10 inch body in my arms.  Garnet had passed.  I lived in a state of darkness and depression for a long long time. I was frantic. I was going to have a baby in 4 months but no baby was coming.  I had a baby room, baby clothes. All The things preparing me to bring this special little life In to the world and become a mother.    We had tried so hard but we lost again. My husbands niece said she would help us to have a baby. She would be our surrogate. The kindest gift of all.  She was healthy, had no complications with the pregnancies.  Things were going smoothly. Two months before Lullas birth I had the 6 month mamo appt. I had changed the doctor group for the mamo. I went and had the mamo. I Waited and the nurse came out and said the radiologist wants to see you.  Ok, I walked back sat down and he said I want to show you your breast tissue. He said most likely you have breast cancer. I almost fell on the floor. I said “But the other doctor 6 months ago said it was a shadow”. He said “this is you now and here are the images from 6 months ago” ITS CANCER!!  OMG ! The CANCER ball started rolling.  I got 2 opinions. I settled on the second opinion. He is a great doctor! 3 weeks before our daughter Lulla would be born We began testing and scheduled surgery. I was terrified. I Had a lumpectomy. I had 2 nodes positive and removed.  After surgery my Doctor told me I was stage 2 and I needed radiation and a hormone blocking pill. My doctor said I’ll give you 3 weeks before starting radiation. Lulla was born a week later. May 4th 2016 Our little baby Lulla, was born I’m a new mommy now. It really happened. After trying so hard for so so long it really happened. After Lulla was born , 3 weeks came and went and I had to start radiation. It was challenging and uncomfortable. I remained healthy. Enjoying the growth of the baby I tried to have for so so long. That’s all I ever wanted. I continued to have regular consults with doctors and mammograms. Thanksgiving morning 2017  I got a call at 4:30 AM in the morning. It was an officer and he said that your store is on fire. I got in my car.  I rushed to my store all alone and sat there so scared and crying. Upset after dealing with what I’ve already dealt with the year before now my store was burning down to the ground. Yet again I was frantic and scared and not know how I was going to survive. It was tumultuous. Over a period of several months I picked a location across the street from my original store and tried to start rebuilding again. And it’s still a work in progress. I also want to give thanks to  all my customers that came in to an empty building when I had nothing to sell hardly and bought whatever they could just for support. April 2021  Nearly Five years had passed since my cancer battle. I went to have my final blood work and it came back normal. Normal tumor markers. So my oncologist doctor said you free to go and not come back. It was glorious. No more cancer. No more cancer doctors. NO MORE !!! July 6th 2021  I had to go for my routine mamo. The nurse said the radiologist wants to see you. OMG NO !!! She said here is your mammogram from last year and here is your mammogram now. She pulled up a side-by-side screen showing me that the current one had grown three tumors two in my right breast and one of my left within the past year. She said you’ve been down this road before. Just have a tissue removed and go on with your life. Going on with my life wasn’t quite that easy. I contacted my cancer surgeon for consultation and he suggested that I have both breast removed which is called a bilateral mastectomy. 2 days after the surgery my daughter of 5 yeas old , was now entering kindergarten. I went to her kindergarten  open house medicated, 4 drains hanging out and breastless. But I did it to be apart of her first day of school.  After the surgery he told me that I had for lymph nodes in my left arm pit and one in my right. I consulted with my oncologist who told me that I needed to proceed with radiation and chemo therapy. And again I had to start a hormone blocking pill. The anxiety was through the roof. I was anxiously awaiting the beginning of all the procedures trying to calm myself down and tell myself you’re alive and it’s going to save your life. You can live your life with your daughter for a long time. Who cares if you lose your hair as long as you live. It grows back.  I visited my oncologist and he asked me if anyone had asked for a PET scan and I said no. I have no idea what that is. He said we just want to see since I  had nodes positive and check everything. He scheduled a pet scan. He called me up for the results came back and said it looks like you have some spots on your pelvic bone but they look odd and we don’t know what they are.  you need to go have a biopsy. I went for the biopsy and waited about a week for the phone call.   I was so scared terrified. October 5th 2021  My phone rang. It was my oncologist. I got my husband and put him on speaker phone. I wanted to run and hide I was so scared. I was shaking so bad I felt like I was going to throw up. The words came out of his mouth that it came back as CANCER on your pelvic bone. He said the staging has to be changed to  STAGE 4 METASTATIC BREAST CANCER. I fell down shakIng and started crying so hard. My thoughts were DEATH at any moment.  My life has never been the same. My oncologist told me that I needed to be on a hormone blocking pills. The hormones are whats feeding the cancer.    I said “Am I going to die?” And he said,  “typically these pills last for about eight years”. No solid answer. He said by then they’ll “PROBABLY” come up with a different pill by then.   I can’t tell you how my world has been crushed. All of this caused from IVF. Trying to get my little daughter into this world has caused me to get STAGE 4 metastatic breast CANCER. I CANT leave her. I can’t. I have to seek out something else. Get a second opinion. To see if there’s a way I can save my life. She cannot live without me. How cruel. I started doing research. A lot of it. Battling thoughts of staying alive and facing death. Battling thoughts of suicide. Battling depression. Just battling. thinking it’s best people aren’t around me now. Because im in a horrible mental state.  Trying to fake it around my daughter.  Lulla  doesn’t understand nor would we get her involved in what is going on. I want her to remain a little innocent Sweet 5-year-old self. Without having to worry about mommy. I’ve never felt the love from anyone much as I feel from her. I’ve never loved anyone this intensely. It’s hard not to cry around her and break down. I tell her mommy has to go potty. I go into the bathroom and hide and yell and scream into a towel. During my research online desperately looking for something and knowing that STAGE 4 is bad news. I ran across a facility in Arizona. They’ve been there for 20 years. They take late stage cancer patients.  They have help people possibly go into remission or even get rid of the cancer all together. They help people that other cancer hospitals across the country cannot. They have to deal with insurance blockages and can only go so far with health care.  The facility in Arizona takes a look at your own DNA and genetic structures. They do immuno therapy and other therapies.  They try to figure out what is going on with your immune system and what is causing this cancer to function and spread.  I reached out to the facility and they are taking on my case. Unfortunately insurance will not cover most of it. If any of you have dealt with insurance You know how difficult they are to deal with. All of my doctors are frustrated with insurance all the time.. For the most part it’s all out of pocket. I have been Blessed as a female business owner for 25 years running my own little Boutique in Palm Harbor Florida. I started with a concept of creativity. I open the 1996 it has give me a humble life. I have always been so humbled that people love my store. That I put my creativity and heart into my business.  People responded to and liked it.   Thank you so much to anyone that is reading this that are my customers and friends. You mean the world to me. I truly mean that. Times have been very hard on everyone.  People that own small businesses have been challenged.   I feel the struggle as well. I’ve never been a person to ask for money or help. I rescued so so many animals out of my own pocket. I get joy and am fulfilled by doing so. I am usually a very private person never asking anything from anyone. I’ve always been able to manage on my own and take care of my own affairs. But now I am in trouble and I need help. I don’t even know how to begin this part of the conversation. After exhausting research I feel confident that if there is hope this medical facility can help me. I will have to move out there for 2 to 3 months and be away from my daughter. I have to have treatments five days a week. I have to have a place to live and some type of transportation. If you can spare anything to help I would greatly appreciate it. I am leaving in 3 weeks to get testing started. I will move soon for the next 2-3 months. I will have to have treatments everyday. We will try to figure this out and stop this spreading , put into remission or possibly  kill the cancer all together.  I feel desperate and URGENT.   I feel so loved.  If there’s a possibility for me to live my life with my little daughter and watch her go through life and being there for her. She the best person I know.  She is kind , empathetic and super smart.  Raising a strong successful  young woman is what I want to be here to do. I don’t want to change the course of her life by dying. Thank you to anyone who is reading this and took the time out of your day. I have often felt embarrassed about this. This is really hard for me to go through cancer and having the fear of death in front of me   but to be on a fundraiser for myself. If all I could ask for is to pass this ON and SHARE it. That could help too.   I thank you again so much from the depths of my heart and my family thanks you again so much too.❤️❤️❤️ With all my love ,  Julie ",13015,100000,4 days

Hace 2 semanas mi mamá empezó a sentir los síntomas de COVID-19. Al principio creímos que lo pasaría sin mayor complicación, pero desafortunadamente nos equivocamos. Su saturación de oxígeno en sangre empezó a bajar de manera brusca (65). Creímos que con el cuidado de una enfermera en casa y un condensador de oxígeno podríamos enfrentar esta dura enfermedad, pero el sábado pasado tuvimos que ingresarla en una clínica en Caracas. Esta enfermedad ha comprometido su corazón, pulmones, sangre y riñones. Actualmente mamá se encuentra intubada en terapia intensiva. Somos 4 hijos que vivimos fuera de Venezuela. Mi hermana mayor, Mariana, afortunadamente pudo viajar desde Perú hasta Caracas para apoyar a mi papá, quien todavía se está recuperando de superar el covid, y estar pendiente de los cuidados de mi mamá. Mi familia no puede afrontar económicamente todos los gastos asociados a clínica y cuidados intensivos. Los días siguen pasando y la suma de la clínica sigue aumentando por lo que nos vemos forzados a recurrir a la ayuda económica de todos aquellos que pudieran ayudar. Cada granito cuenta. Estos días han sido los más duros y difíciles de nuestras vidas. Le pedimos a Dios que le de fortaleza a mi mamá, quien siempre ha sido una mujer muy sana, para su pronta recuperación. Y fortaleza para mi papá y hermana quienes han estado de primera mano encima de los enfermeros y doctores. Nos sentimos con mucho dolor e impotencia por no estar allá.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jonah-during-his-time-of-healing,Support Jonah during his time of healing.,"Team fundraiserLilian Hill and Stephanie Jackson are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Steph Jackson. Greetings family, friends, & loved ones, this is Lilian Hill, I'm raising funds for my dear brother Jonah who's going through an extremely difficult time right now. Jonah Hill is an amazing Hopi/Quechan ethnobotanist, river guide, and artist who expresses his love of life and the natural world through expressions in wood, metal, printmaking, and photography. Jonah is an active father of two beautiful children and a loving husband. Recently after returning from a Grand Canyon river trip, Jonah developed a foot infection that is quickly turning into a serious staphylococcal infection resulting in the removal of two of his right toes and deep tissue removal from his right foot. Complications with diabetes continues to inhibit Jonah's ability to fight the infections and Jonah is facing the possibility of more surgeries and long-term medical treatment. Jonah is a full-time artist, whose sole income is based on his ability to create in his studio and market his art. Jonah has cancelled all of his existing orders and upcoming shows, and has refunded deposits. We have no idea how long Jonah will be in hospital and have no idea how long it will be before he is able to get back into his studio. Making art is one of Jonah's biggest passions and he's extremely nervous about the near future and providing for his family. At this point Jonah is receiving lots of love from family and friends and is staying positive and concentrating healing energy towards deep healing. I'm reaching out for support on Jonah's behalf so that he can concentrate on healing and not worry about the immediate needs associated with paying his mortgage/insurance, putting food on the table, purchasing firewood, and providing for the urgent needs of his family as we move into the winter season. As an uninsured Indigenous person, Jonah may face additional medical costs but we are hopeful that these costs will be covered by programs within the Indian Health Services. (We'll keep you updated!) Any gracious support that you may be able to offer will be greatly appreciated and will go a long way in supporting Jonah and his family through this difficult time. Another way that folks can support is to visit Jonah's website at www.lomayoosi.com to purchase items for sale. Askwali~Kwa'kwai (Thank you) ",22375,35000,11-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/top-secret-canine-companion-for-josie,TOP SECRET -  CANINE COMPANION FOR JOSIE," Hi Team Josie, As many of you already know, Josie and family have been through a lot in the past 3 months. Full details can be found in the Caring Bridge site, but here is a quick synopsis for those new to the room. In early July while celebrating her nephew's birthday, Josie began to have strange symptoms including vision changes, light headedness, dizziness and those all pre-empted a scary abnormal seizure and a trip to the hospital. After an MRI, they found a 19 mm brain tumor on the left parietal lobe that would require surgery. The surgery was a success, and the very experienced surgeon reported back that the tumor appeared benign from its physical appearance. Everyone was hopeful that we were nearing the finish line - but when the pathology came back from some of the world's leading specialists (Mayo, St. Jude, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centers, etc.), they determined that it is an aggressive, malignant brain cancer. She is currently about half way through 6 weeks of targeted proton radiation, and just began chemotherapy that will continue for the next 13 months. They are going after the cancer with everything they have to completely eliminate it - because if it comes back the prognosis isn't good. The outpouring of love and support from family, friends and community over the past several months has been astounding. Many have asked, what can we do, how can we help, where can we donate - and we think we found the answer to that question. Josie's lifelong dream has been to become a veterinarian. She has always loved animals - but especially loves dogs. After hard days of treatment, she's been finding comfort from a neighborhood dog that comes to visit, and you can see that it has a healing effect on her. For a variety of reasons, getting a dog hasn't been in the cards in the Meyer household. Given the fact that we do not know how long we have left with Josie (we are trying to remain hopeful and positive that it will be a very long time), that stance is now going to change.  The family is already inundated with daily trips to Mayo for radiation and chemo, as well as tired from the stress, work and everything going on in life - training a dog/puppy is not something they'll have the time/energy for. In addition, several family members have allergies, asthma and medical conditions that require us to find a dog that is hypo-allergenic. When searching for a fully trained, hypo-allergenic emotional support dog, we realized that it is very expensive. The training is by far the most expensive part - and that is what is needed to make this work. https://www.prideandprejudoodles.com/training-program/ That's where Team Josie can help. Any money donated to this GoFundMe will help offset these costs. We are starting the process of finding Josie a furry companion that she can have by her side now through hard times, and hopefully for many years to come. Studies have shown the great impact that animals can have on health outcomes, and we can't think of a better gift to Josie. If you'd like to contribute to Josie and the family, I can promise you that this will be the most impactful thing Josie has ever experienced and seeing her happy is the most important thing to us. Thank you all and please keep Josie and the rest of the family in your thoughts and prayers! Love, Josie and the Meyer FamilyP.S. REMINDER - THIS IS A SECRET! PLEASE DON'T MENTION TO JOSIE, NOAH, OR THEIR FRIENDS :) Feel free to share on Facebook or directly with friends and family - she doesn't have any social media at this time.P.P.S. We've already started the process of getting the fur-child and as soon as we have pictures, dates and details, we'll be posting them here and on the Caring Bridge site. ",18005,25000,5 days

I met Logan when I was in the 3rd grade. I was new in the area and he befriended me. We shared a love for sports and funny youtube videos. We were so close that even our parents became best friends. After a few years we moved again and I hadn’t seen my bud in awhile, but that didn’t keep us from staying in touch. After graduation we found out we got in the same college and decided to be dorm mates. We were so excited to be heading off on our own and make some new memories together. As we all know college is a time for discovery, learning, making new friends and maybe a mistake or two. On Saturday October 25th one of those mistakes were made. One that I never imagined my friends and I would have to go through. Logan was accidentally ejected out of the bed of my truck. The accident put him in ICU. He is currently suffering from a fractured skull, broken ribs, a pierced lung, and some bloods clots in his brain.  My heart is broken for him and the pain he is experiencing. I am still in shock that this happened and want to do all that I can to help him and his family. Please help me help Logan. Anything you can give can help with his medical bills, rehab costs and more. If you can’t donate please send a prayer that Logan has a speedy and successful recovery.  Thank you ",16309,25000,1 day
https://www.gofundme.com/f/calvin-chef-c-of-chef-cs-smhokin-pot,COVID-19 (ICU)Calvin Owner of Chef C’s Smhokin Pot," Hello we are the family of Calvin (Chef C). Chef C (Calvin) of Chef C’s Smhokin Pot and his family are i need of your help. Chef C wasn’t always a chef. He left his career as a respiratory therapist for Long Beach memorial hospital about 4 years ago to pursue his passion for cooking. The father of one (cailey), created a family based business which started in 2016 doing catering, festivals and events in his surrounding cities and neighboring states. From their in 2017 he got a food truck and is now doing it all while running a brick and mortar location in Carson, California. Of coarse a business is just as good as it’s employees and the family and friends that stand behind it and the customers and anyone whom supports. Chef C (Calvin) has now became affected by what our world has been trying to escape for almost two years now ..Covid-19. Some have mild symptoms, some have severe symptoms, and then their are others whose symptoms become life threatening. Chef C tested positive for covid 19 3 weeks ago. He was home for 5 days until his symptoms began to worsen. He went to the ER and was admitted because his oxygen levels were not stable. For another 5 days he struggled through the pain and discomfort while on oxygen as the doctors and nurses monitored him and tried to keep him comfortable. But Calvin ..ChefC… he couldn’t do it on his own anymore. He said he was tired. Him trying to breath on his own was becoming to much. That’s because pneumonia had already form and began to worsen his symptoms. His lungs were stiff and it had turn into ARDS. Since then he had to be intibated. The one thing that we were trying to avoid. Everyday the reports are heart breaking and we can’t believe what’s happening. All we can do is wait day by day for updates. Hoping to hear any piece of good news. Praying for a miracle!! We are at the point now where we need all the support, love, help and prayers we can get! As the days pass and we sit hoping praying and waiting, things like most, start to fall apart. In those times are the times you have to be brave and volnurable enough to not only share your hardship but also ask for help because even when it falls apart their are people who are willing to try to help put it back together. At this time, we the family are in hopes that you all can help us contribute to the process of his well being and save what he has worked so hard for. His lively hood, the thing he has put all his dedication into to make you all happy, with food for your soul. If you can donate awesome, if you can go to the restaurant or the food truck and support that would be awesome or/and send some prayers up and be in agreeance with us that he will overcome this!!! That covid-19 will not be the thing that takes his life no matter how bad it may look, no matter how bad the doctors reports are. In whichever way you are able to contribute to supporting us at this time. We are forever greAtful!!! Thank you❤️ ",10855,25000,3 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/2dfjk-help-josh-fight-cancer,Help Josh fight Cancer," We set this up in Josh's name on his behalf to ensure this 100% supports his needs.Josh is a loving husband, energetic dad of three, thoughtful friend, beloved son and brother, school teacher in Michigan, follower of Jesus, humble servant in his church, and all around great guy. If you know him, you have been helped, encouraged, or strengthened by his drive and passion. No age is good to get cancer, but for a 42 year old father of 3 teenagers, 18, 15, and 13, it’s way too young. Josh was recently diagnosed with a very rare but highly treatable form of blood cancer called Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL). The blood cells can grow out of control and collect in certain parts of the body. It can just happen; it’s not hereditary and doesn’t depend on diet and exercise. There is no cure, but treatments are effective at putting HCL in remission for years. Josh’s wife, Kim, is a Lutheran school teacher at Shepherd of the Lakes in Brighton, Michigan. Josh taught in Utica Schools for 18 years. Although he loved his job and his students, Josh began teaching in Hartland in September 2021 to have a shorter commute, going from 2 hours every day to just 9 minutes. Even in his short time the Hartland community has been amazing in their support of Josh. However, there is only so much they can do. Because of this move, Josh was not able to carry over any vacation or sick days. Consequently, most of his medical leave will not be covered. Long term disability will kick in after 90 school days. For the next 3-6 months, the doctors have told him he cannot work. As a result, Josh will go completely without pay until approximately January or February 2022. In addition to these 4+ months without pay, Josh must pay insurance premiums of $1800 per month. Once disability does kick in, it will be at 66% of his normal pay. Josh will start chemo on November 1st, but expenses are already starting to accrue due to the amount of tests (CT scan, X-rays, lots of blood tests, transfusions, bone marrow biopsy, etc.) and visits to various specialists. Unfortunately, there will be many more to come over the next 6 months or so as well. Furthermore, if Josh spikes a fever at all after chemo, he must go to the hospital immediately and is at risk of dying if he even catches a common cold. We are asking for your help. We hope to raise enough money to alleviate the financial stress and impact of Josh’s treatment so that he can focus on what’s most important—his health. Our goal is to raise at least $50,000. Your financial contributions will go toward medical deductibles, copays, prescriptions, and uncovered medical expenses, as well as everyday living expenses, including the added expenses of gas and parking associated with traveling to the hospital. In addition to financial support, we are asking for prayers. Not only for Josh, but for his wife Kim and his children, Caleb, Jacob and Allie. We trust God and know the strength and power of prayer. Cancer is scary, but our God is greater. ",12165,50000,1 day

Casey was having some health issues almost a year ago, and being the responsible human being that she is, she went to a few different specialists- and nothing was wrong- or so we thought. Casey has an extremely rare form of cancer. Good news is, it's so slow growing and she has been probably developing it for years without any effects, until recently. Bad news is, there is no actual way to fight off this cancer (pending a really cool new treatment that has been studied and developed for about 2-3 years, but still in the testing stage). After Casey was having some health issues and had seen some specialists, she changed her diet and hoped for the best, but at the end of July she had to be rushed off to the ER for excruciating abdominal pain. Eventually the pain stopped, and the doctors didn't think there was a reason to dig deeper, but let her know that she could get a certain screening done just for peace of mind. Casey didn't think it was needed, but she asked for this (very expensive) test anyway, just to be sure. Come to find out, they found a huge mass in her intestines as well a bunch of small tumors along her pelvic wall. They tried to remove the big mass, and they got most of it, including taking out some of her intestine. But we waited a few weeks to get more results, and then we got the call that it was stage four. NOW PAUSE! This is a rare form of cancer, so yes it is technically at stage four, but there was positive news to find out later. But once we found out it was stage four, I think that was the scariest moment/range of time of the Duryea's and Lewis' lives. Fast forward a month later, and we get more and more information. Although there is still nothing to kill it/stop the growing like what Chemotherapy can offer, we did receive wonderful news!! Casey will be undergoing surgery on November 2nd of this year, and essentially they will be able to go in and extract the small baby tumors along the pelvic wall. This surgery will be very invasive and will require many nights in the hospital as well as time taken off of work to heal. But like I told Casey, ""at least your expiration date is a lot further away than we thought it was going to be just a couple weeks ago"". We are beyond thankful that there is a way of prolonging the cancer so Casey can continue being a loving mother, caring wife, and overall just a friggin' wonderful human being that everyone surrounding her gets to enjoy!!The reason we are calling upon our friends and family is because although insurance pays for A LOT of it, there are and will be a bit of expenses that aren't covered. And it is my hope that we can all ban together in order to help ease the Duryea's medical bills and overall take away that financial burden they have encountered. I'm sure you know how Casey has worked tirelessly in order to get out of debt, and with a Middle School band teacher's salary, paired with Chris's newly developed construction company, along with everything related to their new(ish) son's cost of living, finances were already being spread super thin. Anything is appreciated and I have started a Meal Train for the span of time that she will be in recovery. It is much appreciated if food or money is donated during this time and I'm excited to see what life has to offer post surgery. Thank you for any contributions, and if it's not in the cards to offer money or food right now, the Duryea's would appreciate something as simple as being in your thoughts and prayers. Thank you for any and all support and thank you for all the compassion and prayers during this time- let's wish for a happy and speedy recovery  and let's cheer Casey on her way through this journey!",20081,15000,5 days

On a Saturday morning, in the comfort of their own home, my son and his girlfriend had theirlives shattered in an instant.  A domesticviolence incident in the apartment next doorresulted in a bullet coming through the wall and hitting  Sally in the back of her head.  She was standing in the kitchen making breakfast for their dog Niyah.  Nick looked up to ask Sally what the noise was- only to see her crumpled body on the floor.  He held her, blood flowing from her head as hescreamed for her to wake up.  He called 911 and grabbed towels to wrap her head in until the paramedics arrived. The Arapahoe Sheriff department acted swiftly and arrested theshooter.  The officers took Nick to LittletonAdventist Hospital where he waited for news on Sally.   Since  that day, Nick has stayed by Sally’s bedside only leaving to switch visitation with her family.  Sally has undergone multiple procedures to relieve pressure from her brain. The 9mm bullet came through the apartment wall and shattered her skull- traversing acrossHer brain to the front of her face.There are good days and bad.  Nick has identified a professional to help him deal with PTSD and the horrors that he sees when he closes his eyes.  Sally remains in life support but has recently shown signs of movement & is beginning to respond to verbal commands by lifting a finger or wiggling her toes.Both have a lifetime of care and healing ahead of them. Life will never be the same.It is far too early to understand the possible outcome scenarios.   Love, prayers and kindness from family, friends, the community and health care workers has been powerful.  We appreciate your donations as the one thing that we know is that regardless of the outcome- this young couple of six years will have a lifetime of needs.  I am Nick's mother and can assure you that there is no greater pain than not being able to take pain away from your child - even at the age of 27.thank you for helping to raise funds for their care, well-being, living and medical expenses.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/death-of-wife-and-loving-mother-of-4,"Passing of Shantel and her premature son, William"," This fundraiser is for Shantel Konop and is run by her family.Our beloved Shantel recently passed on October 20th, 2021 followed by her premature son, William on October 21st, 2021. Shantel was a wonderful mother who touched the lives of those around her. She leaves behind her husband Michael and their three children, Isabella, Sawyer and Garrett.  This is her story...On October 13, Shantel went to the hospital at 24 weeks pregnant with Covid complications and was admitted immediately. Due to shortness of breath and the inability to maintain the appropriate oxygen levels for her and the baby, she transferred to the ICU.  Hours later she flew by helicopter to Aurora Mount Sinai hospital in Milwaukee where they could manage her delicate condition with a higher medical expertise. On Saturday, her oxygen levels stabilized, she was upbeat and felt she was getting better.  She talked to many family members throughout the morning and afternoon.  That night, her oxygen levels plummeted, Shantel made the decision to go on a ventilator to help baby William. She remained on the ventilator until Wednesday morning, October 20th, when her vitals dropped, and they had to deliver baby William. William was born 14.5 weeks prematurely, and shortly afterwards Shantel gained her crown.  William was doing as well or better than expected for being so premature.  Their Pastor baptized William Malakai in an emergency ceremony at the hospital.  Suddenly, Thursday morning, while in his father’s arms, William too passed peacefully, forever joining Shantel in heaven.Shantel devoted her life to caring for her 3 children: Isabella (13), Sawyer (4.5), and Garrett (1.5). There is no comparison to a mother’s love, unending, enduring, unconditional, and everlasting… and was unfortunately gone way too soon. The proceeds of your donation will help with unexpected medical bills, funeral arrangements, everyday living expenses while Michael is off work, and ongoing child care expenses for the children. We thank you in advance for taking the time to read this, pray for the family, and donate if you’re able.  Hug your family and friends, and give thanks to the Lord for their lives today to honor them.  ",26801,30000,7 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-glenda-fight-her-battle-with-cancer,Help Glenda Fight Her Battle With Cancer," In August of 2021, my grandmother, Glenda Slaymaker was diagnosed with breast cancer. After many more scans and tests a lesion on the colon was detected. Meanwhile, she was also having gallbladder complications. The lesion on her colon was believed to be Colon Cancer. Fast forward to October 1st, Glenda went in for a routine colonoscopy for the surgeon to confirm whether or not the lesion was Colon Cancer. Unfortunately the surgeon was not able to complete the colonoscopy due to a large blockage. Glenda then underwent emergency surgery immediately. The surgeon believed if it was not addressed, it could have been life threatening. Now all that was left was to wait for the results that no family would ever want to hear. My grandma Glenda was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer. It had metastasized to her colon, gallbladder, and her bones. After receiving this diagnosis followed numerous hospital stays, tests, more scans, and more medical expenses that are only continuing to add up. Your donations would go towards past, current, and future medical bills and expenses. For example, weeks of nutrition bags that insurance would not cover, totaling $150 dollars per day. Glenda is now being cared for through Hospice but is hopeful and seeking medical advice at The Cleveland Clinic. Any remaining funds will go to any expenses that it will cost to give her husband Randy the ability to travel back and forth, as well as covering expenses to stay there with her if needed. Our family is grateful for any small donation to help relieve as much financial burden and worry from Glenda and her husband Randy. We are blessed with the most loving and strong support system as we navigate this hard season in life. The entire family feels your prayers, and we couldn’t be any more thankful. Thank you.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/new-wheelchair-for-atlas,New Wheelchair for Atlas!," Hi! My name is Atlas!  I'm a furry who uses a wheelchair due to a condition called Transverse Myelitis (a condition which causes inflammation in the spinal cord). My first wheelchair has seen its share of love, conventions, events, and travel, and it's hard to part with it, but it's time for an upgrade. There are many things wrong with my previous chair from years of love. This includes a cracked camber tube, bent spokes, worn in back rest, and much more. Due to this, I was given a new prescription for a brand new chair. I work with a great team that includes a neurologist, a seating clinician, and an ATP, who fit me for a customized chair that is perfectly fit to my body and lifestyle. While they do all the background work with insurance, I have to come up with my half of payment since my insurance covers only 50% for medical equipment.  (Dumb US Healthcare system.) Did you know that some wheelchairs cost as much as $45,000? There are many different types of wheelchairs, and the style I was prescribed was a manual lightweight custom chair. Being manual instead of electric, this keeps the chair in the $10,000 range. While working with my team, we decided on some new specs that will make my ride much more comfortable. While this raises the cost some, it should allow the chair to last well over 5 years. Thank you so much for the help!  ",6250,6500,3 days

Karen has gotten Courtney back home in Illinois and she has begun treatment at the University of Chicago for a 1-month in-hospital stay. Following this intense, rigorous treatment will be 2-3 out-patient chemotherapy sessions weekly for several months until remission and then maintenance treatment for 2 years.

Unfortunately, in addition to medical bills, the cost of traveling to and from the hospital, daily parking fees, and the constant need for expensive medications is taking its toll on the family financially. In the meantime, Courtney's personal bills continue to accumulate.  The family is very optimistic that Courtney will win this battle and live a long, healthy life. However, this journey will continue for months and years to come beyond their financial means. Any donation will help ease some of the financial struggles they are experiencing.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-our-beloved-ryan-jailbreak-the-hospital,Helping our beloved Ryan Jailbreak the Hospital," Dear friends, family and fellow hopheads - we're asking for your help in getting our good friend Ryan (of Hopsmash and Egoproof), and his wife, Angela, get back on their feet.In late September, our beloved Ryan started feeling what he thought was flu-like symptoms. After progressively getting worse for a week, unable to move within a few days, and in excruciating pain, he was admitted to a San Francisco hospital on October 1st. For the first couple weeks of October, Ryan was kept heavily sedated as doctors ran numerous tests to figure out what was causing extreme pain and inflammation in most of his joints. Fluid was pulled from his left knee, to test for a possible diagnosis. No luck. Then he had neck surgery to relieve pressure on his spinal cord from inflammation caused by a pocket of fluid between two discs in his spine. Having two samples of fluid that didn't produce any results in cultures, they sent off samples of both to University of Washington for a PCR test, to see if they could identify what this was. On October 13th, nearly two weeks in, they received actual results: Group B Strep . Ryan then had to have surgery on both his knees and his left shoulder to drain the fluid and wash out those joints. This was necessary, as they discovered during surgery that his right knee had a large amount of pre-septic fluid in it. We’re grateful to now have a diagnosis and a way forward – but the path remains relatively long and arduous. Ryan will remain in the hospital for a while longer and will also need to remain in San Francisco for physical and occupational therapy, as well as a 6-week course of IV antibiotics. He will need to relearn how to do the very basic of tasks…tasks we, the healthy, often take for granted. Something as simple as sitting up or standing without assistance/losing breath, brushing his teeth, etc. San Francisco is a long way from home for Ryan and Angela, who were in the area for a housesit that was supposed to last through October 17th. The costs of having to unexpectedly remain in the San Francisco area, even being as modest as possible, are highly straining on their financial resources. Additionally, the insurance company has decided to not accept any of the claims as of this point, for reasons that are still unclear – which possibly means hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical costs. To date, on top of the 3+ week hospital stay itself, he had a visit to the Emergency Department at the beginning, multiple daily blood draws/lab testing, several MRIs, several ultrasounds, several echocardiograms, two surgeries in four different sites, a mountain of meds, and so much more. Those of you that know Ryan or have had the joy of sharing a pint (or three) with him know that he is a big-hearted man with a good helping of sass. He cares deeply for his people and his community, especially the craft beer community. And his passion and his work for mental health awareness via creative projects like Egoproof is a testament to his compassion. Grateful for all that he’s brought to us and his people, we (a group of friends) have come together to help raise some money and good cheer to help Ryan and Ang on their way – to help alleviate the burden of medical costs while ensuring that they can remain in San Francisco to see his recovery through. All funds will go directly towards basic needs (i.e. housing) in the short term, and towards medical expenses in the medium term, once the bills hit. Anything above and beyond what’s needed will be donated to charity. Any and every little bit helps – and is greatly appreciated. In the meantime, continue to send your thoughts and good vibes to help Ryan get well and break out of his hospital bed soon! ",9410,23000,3 days

He had been feeling tired over the last few months but thought this was normal stress due to starting a new job 4 months ago. Unfortunately, he was told he had an enlarged spleen and ALL Leukemia. He has had 2 bone marrow biopsies; the results of the second biopsy are still pending. His oncologist feels he has PH+ ALL type Leukemia, which will be confirmed with the second biopsy. He has a long road ahead of him and will be off of work for at least 18 months to 2 years. Despite this news, he has remained positive and strong. We want Rob to focus his energy and thoughts on fighting this battle without the added stress of being unable to work. We want Erica, his wife, and Daylon his son, to be by his side, supporting him, and loving him 100%. It is my hope that by starting this GoFundMe, that we can alleviate some of the financial burdens my brother and his family will be faced with.Rob called me to discuss possible treatment regimens,  he asked my opinion and said, ""Toni, if I can help other people in the future faced with Leukemia, I feel I should do it."" Needless to say, he had to ask me if ""I"" was ok because of course, I was holding back tears hearing him think so selflessly. Please know, we appreciate all donations, no donation is too small. Please also keep Rob and his Family in your prayers. We will keep you up to date on Rob's fight! We appreciate all the words of encouragement, thoughts, and prayers.

My name is Debbie and I’m a black transgender woman fundraising to support my medical transition after moving across the county to Los Angeles last summer to start this new journey in my life and leave my emotionally and physically abusive transphobic family behind. I’m currently in a gender affirming crisis right now. I need help more than ever before to raise: $55,000 FACIAL FEMINIZATION SURGERY PROCEDURES  $8,100 OPERATING ROOM & ANESTHESIA FEES $21,900 AFTER CARE (1 MONTH HEALING, 5 MONTHS SECONDARY RECOVERY) AND PLATFORM FEES I need for my facial feminization surgery procedures scheduled for September 22nd with doctor Harrison Lee.     It has been very depressing knowing that I have been struggling to move forward to cover the costs of the care that I really need to solve my crisis. I just want to be happy and become my fullest self and it’s unfortunate that I am in a gender affirming crisis right now. I am not someone who has family or friends to support me in this sensitive time in my life medically transitioning. I was kicked out of the only home I had ever known in December 2018 after a violent physical altercation occurred between myself and a family member in my household which left crowdfunding as my only option to pursue my transition.      I defended myself and this family member ended up pressing charges against me. I struggled to find work for a year and a half due to what was on my record due to that incident and I was laid off from the one job I found after applying to hundreds of locations shortly before COVID-19 made finding work impossible. After spending months in isolation, I decided to start a fundraiser to support my medical transition and start my career in a new city. Since I have been living here, I have already been the target of transphobic violence on several occasions as well. A lot of the adversity I have faced has made it difficult to get settled and focus on stability and my independence.  I am encouraging all of my transgender allies online to support this campaign to help me finally affirm my gender and move forward with my life by chipping in with a donation. Your contributions and support really do make a difference and if we all band together I’m sure I can reach the goal by my deadline of August 31st, 2021.  ",57581,85000,5-Aug-21

An MRI had revealed a mass on Jim’s liver, and a biopsy was scheduled. After returning home from the procedure, he began to have chest pains and while looking for the cause, a CT scan at the emergency room revealed more masses.

Jim was officially diagnosed with Stage 4 terminal Bile Duct Cancer with multiple metastases on Monday, Sept 27th. As a healthy 44 year old, this has all come as a devastating shock to our family and friends. Jim is a hard working husband, son, brother, uncle, and father.

The big things right now are out of our control so we are going to focus on our relationships in life that we love and cherish. As the selfless person that Jim is, he is more worried about the family he will potentially leave behind. We are hoping to raise money to assist Jim with the financial burdens of a terminal illness, and the means to live his life as long and normal as possible. Jim has gone from working full time and supporting his family to fighting cancer full time. Anything you can donate will be truly appreciated. Everything we can do to help and surround Jim with love and support is what is most important so he can continue to appreciate all of the good things in his life. From Jim - “I feel extremely strong mentally and I still feel very good physically. I am going to fight this with everything I have. I want you all to know how much your love and support means to me.” Updates: Jim had spinal surgery on 10/4/21 to remove some tumors in his neck/spine and place plates and screws to reinforce his spine where a tumor was beginning to compromise his spinal cord, placing him at risk of paralysis. The objective was to strengthen the spine so that it’s safe to begin radiation and chemotherapy treatments. As of 10/5/21 the surgery was successful in giving him a chance at as much time with us as possible, he remains at UNC to recover. ",46359,50000,6-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-nikki-through-her-cancer-treatments,Help Nikki through her cancer treatments," I'm Robert, Nikki's brother. I've known Nikki my entire life as she was born just after I turned 13. It was the coolest feeling in the world having a baby sister. A few years later I remember coming home on military leave, riding my ""Top Gun"" motorcycle and driving her to first grade (for a chance to meet her teacher), apparently I only impressed the 6 year olds.  I remember threatening the neighborhood boy to leave her alone when she was 13. I remember taking her to get her belly button pierced at 16 and signing as her father... and I remember when she followed in my footsteps joining the Air Force at 19. One of my proudest memories was seeing her drive up on Strawberry Hill in Camp Victory, Iraq... she climbed out of her HMMWV, M-16 dragging the dirt, boots 3 sizes too big. I came to her and gave her the biggest hug, thinking how proud our father would be. I've never felt like a father to Nikki. We lost our dad when she was 14. But I have always felt like her guardian and friend, and brother, of course. She is so strong, strong willed, smart, and independent. At 5 foot nothing she holds her own, never quitting, never giving up. Nikki has an incredible ability to balance it all... a mother of four, holds a professional job, all the time in the world for her kids and family... when does she sleep? I have so much admiration for her and nothing is more important to her than her family and children. With so much love and goodness given by our girl, fate has dealt her a sour hand. In May, Nikki was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer. This is a rare type of breast cancer for a 39 year old. Something that grows undetected without scans. Unfortunately the cancer has metastasized, spread throughout parts of her body, and is now classified as stage 4 cancer. Nikki is receiving weekly treatments at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. The doctors and staff are great. Many of her treatments require day long and overnight stays to complete a series of labs, scans, and infusions. The cost of the trips, medications, and co-pays are mounting up. Nikki is still able to work close to full-time, but I see the fatigue setting in. Her family is chipping in every way imaginable, but the overall cost are taking a toll. Nikki has decided to sell her house in Indialantic, FL. to help lessen the burden and to keep above float. Personally, I recognize the individual stress of financial struggles, moving, and being sick. Nikki is facing it all at once.. Its insurmountable, but she is taking it in stride. She is diligent with her treatments, keeping with her work ethics, and giving ever spare minute to her children. She is an inspiration to others, focused on getting well, and selfless every minute of the day. Today, Nikki needs our help. She need financial support to complete her move, to have a little time off work, and to help with her treatments, meds, and co-pays. Nikki is all in, pulling ever lever possible to lessen the burden on her friends and family. With your help we can give Nikki time to rest and that peace of mind that she can continue her treatments and provide for her family. I love this girl with every ounce of my heart and I know you guys do too. I would trade place with her in a minute if I could. She is so sweet, caring, tender, and loving, but now she needs our support.  Please keep Nikki and her family in your thoughts and prayers and please contribute if you are able. Thank you and God bless you. ",21250,35000,3 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-logan-recover-from-a-traumatic-brain-injury,Help Logan Recover from a Traumatic Brain Injury," On September 17th 2021, Logan suffered a serious hypoxic brain injury during the night which caused trauma to his brain. He was admitted to Scripps Memorial Hospital ICU in La Jolla on September 18th, where he remained in a coma on a ventilator for over two weeks. Logan's family and friends gathered together outside of the hospital, continually praying for his recovery. Even while his parents received very difficult news, prayers were requested as everyone who knows and loves Logan continued to pray for a miracle. On October 6th, Logan's ventilator tube was removed and he miraculously started whispering a few words, from nearly unresponsive to talking!! Some of his first words were ""I love you"" to his mom and dad, Michelle and Phil. On October 13th, Logan was moved out of ICU. Logan could continue to talk, although not much, and he could answer questions. He could recognize the voices of people who were talking to him, but he could not see very well. He could make out shapes and colors. Logan started physical therapy and could move his arms and legs, wiggle his toes, and open and close his hands. He expressed emotions and smiled. October 20th was Logan's 26th birthday, something that only a few weeks earlier was in question. Phil and Michelle were so thankful for the love, healing energy and faith that has kept Logan here and got him to this point. Logan was brought outside on a hospital bed and Phil, Michelle, friends and friends' moms were all able to talk with him, wish him a happy birthday, and even share some laughs with him. To see him smile, laugh and joke with people he loves and who love him is a gift. His eyesight has progressively come back which truly is a blessing. He will be leaving the hospital soon and moving to a rehabilitation facility as the next phase of his recovery begins. We do not yet know what Logan's road to recovery will entail. He will have many obstacles to overcome. Our hope is that Logan will make a full recovery. This fund will assist with medical bills and future rehablitative support. Logan's dad Phil, his mom Michelle, and brother Philip thank you from the bottom of their hearts for your continued love and prayers for Logan. ",71643,100000,6 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-autumn-edmiston-fight-cancer,Help Autumn Edmiston Fight Cancer," Hi, my name is Amy Wallace. I am raising money for my 22 year-old niece, Autumn Edmiston, to help her while she receives medical treatment for Ewing Sarcoma, a rare cancer that occurs primarily in the bone and soft tissue. This was supposed to be a time for Autumn to begin the next chapter of her adult life. She graduated magna cum laude from Cleveland State University in 2021, with a Bachelor's Degree in Education. In August, she was hired by Euclid City Schools as a Language Arts teacher for first and second graders. Some people are created to be teachers and make a difference. Autumn is clearly one of those special people. She loves her school, her students, and coworkers. It’s no surprise to her family and friends to hear how much they all love her too. Autumn began experiencing lower back pain several months ago. The pain grew in intensity and MRI scans revealed that the source of the pain is a mass in her sacroiliac joint. The sacroiliac joints link the pelvis and spine. Autumn is beginning aggressive, inpatient chemotherapy in early November. She will need to spend approximately 14 days per month in the hospital for the next three months. She will then undergo radiation therapy. Because Ewing Sarcoma is primarily a pediatric cancer, she will be receiving treatment at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland. Our family is asking for your help. Our goal is to raise enough money to alleviate the financial stress and impact of Autumn’s treatment so that she can focus on what’s most important—her health. Because Autumn just started teaching this year, she does not yet have accrued vacation or sick time, and her medical leave will be uncovered. Your contributions will go toward medical deductibles, copays, prescriptions, and uncovered medical expenses, as well as everyday living expenses, including the added expenses of gas and parking associated with traveling to the hospital. We are hoping you can help us raise enough money to make it easier for my sister, Rebecca, Autumn’s mom, to take unpaid time off work to be there for Autumn during her inpatient treatments. Despite the shock and unfairness of this diagnosis, Autumn continues to lift and inspire us with her beautiful smile, her great sense of humor, and her gratitude for all the kindness that has already been shown to her. Every time we talk, she tells me how lucky she is to have such a loving family, how grateful she is to have so many people who care about her, and how much the kindness of doctors, nurses, coworkers, and even strangers means to her. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. The Edmiston and Kolz families appreciate your donations, prayers, and support. I know Autumn’s beautiful heart, and I’m certain she will pay your kindness forward every chance she gets. With Gratitude, Amy ",32555,30000,5 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/nrhfpn-medical-treatment-in-israel,Medical Treatment in Israel,"Team fundraiserShawn House and Amy House are organizing this fundraiser. Hi, my name is Shawn House and I have been dealing with Mucosal Melanoma going on 9 years this month. I have been through many ups and downs through this whole trial. Up until now, I have been able to beat or at least subdue the cancer through surgeries, bio-chemo, radiation and immunotherapies. I am at a point now to where the treatments are becoming limited with surgery not a viable option. My cancer started off in the sinuses which was resected in 2012. After the resection, I opted to go through radiation which seemed to fend off everything until 2015 until it metastasized to one of my testicles. At this point, I had it removed and shortly after went through 4 rounds of bio-chemo at MD Anderson in Houston, TX. This was a huge obstacle having to be hooked up to all kinds of monitoring devices and several different kinds of chemotherapy drugs for a week straight in the hospital. This seemed to keep the cancer at bay up until 2018 until it decided to metastasize to my left lower lung lobe. Luckily, I was able to have this removed by 2019. After the removal was when I started a steady dose of Opdivo/Yervoy for 4 rounds and after that was complete, I was strictly on Opdivo for close to a year and half and it seemed to be doing to the job up until it decided to metastasize some more. Currently, it has spread to the right lung, chest, stomach area and pancreas. I have been through 2 clinical trials with no success. I recently went through some radiation for the pancreas as this was top priority. Thankfully, the tumors have stabilized in this area with some even shrinking but this is only a temporary solution. As of now, I am currently not on any treatments but I was supposed to start a chemo/immunotherapy regimen but I am having to jump through hoops to get Keytruda approved so it has been pushed back for who knows how long. I should note, that this treatment is being used to hopefully keep me going until TIL treatment becomes available which has been shown to have remarkable results. Let me back up a second though, I recently went to see another oncologist in Orlando in hopes of getting into this TIL trial but the trial was closed off a week before....Ugh. My options here in the states are either to wait for the trial to open back up which may never happen or wait until the FDA approves it at the beginning of the year which there is no guarantee that will even happen either. My other option would be to go to Sheba Medical Center in Israel to get the treatment I need as they are not restricted nor hindered by the FDA and I can get treatment fairly quickly. Unfortunately, this would not be covered by insurance and I would have to come out of pocket $120,000 - $150,000. My wife and I are fortunate to be able to come up with at least some of the cost but it would be difficult to come up with the whole $150,000 which I am basing everything off of. On a personal note, Yahweh has given myself, my family and friends so much strength and comfort during these trying times. We all have to remember that he is the Great Physician full of mercy, grace, longsuffering, compassion and the likes thereof. I pray daily for guidance, strength and help, to let go of my pride and putting my trust in him without wavering. I understand this is a huge ask from everyone so I do not want anyone to feel obligated. Everything is in Yahweh's Hands, His will be done as His ways our higher than our ways. After much prayer, I believe this door has been opened up to me and I just need to try and figure out a way to make it happen but at the same time, I understand that it may not be feasible. If not, I'm sure Yahweh will open up another door for me. Please feel free to share!

Most of you know the incredible fight our sister, Amanda, has had to undergo this past decade. From getting and beating Ovarian cancer, to then fighting to beat not one, but TWO brain tumors. It's been a long hard road that we all hoped was over. Unfortunately, our hopes were dashed when another growth was discovered in her chest cavity. She’s been through treatment after treatment both clinical and experimental. The journey has been long and she’s still fighting. This latest spot is growing too fast and we’ve exhausted all options. We need another treatment in our arsenal against this disease and we need it fast. Luckily, we have found another experimental trial treatment that could be what we need. She’s had good results from the experimental treatment on her brain tumor, so we are hopeful and praying this one will work as well. The problem, of course, is that the experimental treatment isn’t cheap. In fact, the treatment plus all of the doctors appointments and the travel needed to get to the hospitals is going to cost nearly $100,000. Like most families, they do not have that amount of money readily available, which is where you come in. We are asking for help raising money to make sure Amanda can get the treatment that could help save her life. Please, any amount is appreciated to help us raise enough for her. We hope that you will respect her and our family’s wishes to keep calls and texts to a minimum – we’d prefer you reach out to Marianne, KJ, Elayne, or Ellen so that we can share messages and well wishes. Amanda and Andrew need time to focus on treatment and fighting what we hope to be as the last bout of cancer. We especially are trying to minimize the impact and trauma to our children and hope you can understand why we want to minimize gossip.

Not only is she a mother, but she is a daughter, a best friend, a wife, a grandma, and an overall amazing, hardworking, strong and beautiful woman. Recently, she sold our house in New York to move to South Carolina. In the midst of this she found out that she has cancer of the uterus. During the surgery to have the cancer removed, the doctors found that it had spread to her lymph nodes. She will have to undergo 6 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation. During this time, she will not be able to work. She’s worked as a sales rep for a tile company for almost 25 years to support her family. The money would go towards medical expenses as well as her everyday necessities, like groceries. This is a difficult time for her and all her family and friends. She has been so strong throughout all of this. Stronger than I can imagine anyone else being. Her dream is to volunteer in her free time at the zoo near her new home once she’s able to move there. She’s currently staying with her dad and stepmom while she goes through treatment. My mom is an amazing, generous, smart, funny and overall incredible person. She would give anything to see the people she loves happy. That’s all she did in the 18 years she’s raised me. She’d sacrifice anything for her loved ones. As her family, we can only do so much. She needs all the support she can get. We understand many people are not in a place to donate, so even simply sharing with your friends, coworkers, and family would mean the world to us.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-christians-cancer-treatment,Help Support Christian's Cancer Treatment,"David Teves is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Deanna Palacio. Our 17-year-old nephew, Christian, was recently diagnosed with myoepithelial carcinoma (MC) in August of 2021. MC is extremely rare and affects less than 1% of all people diagnosed with cancer. It is aggressive and has a high rate of recurrence and metastasis. Doctors do not have much information about MC or how to treat it. Due to its rarity, doctors admit chemotherapy has not proven successful against it.  We need your help. His treatment options will not be fully covered by insurance. He needs treatment that can heal him and bring him back to full health, in hopes he can play his spot on the varsity football team, enjoy his senior year of high school, and fully live out his life. Christian's Story: Christian was born in Hawaii and now lives in Silverdale, Washington with his family. He is a faithful follower of Jesus and a loving role model for his younger brother and sisters. He enjoys playing sports, especially football and boxing. Upon graduation from high school, he wants to pursue a career as a firefighter. In 2018, Christian's mom felt a lump on the back of his neck, near his spine. When she took him to the doctor to have it checked out, the doctor passed it off as a muscle tear since he was so active in sports.  In June 2021, the doctors finally became concerned about the lump and performed an ultrasound of the area. It did not yield any clues because the tumor was too far beneath the muscle. They performed a CT scan and an MRI which confirmed the lump was indeed a tumor on the cervical area of Christian's spine. The doctors performed a biopsy which took six weeks for pathologists at the University of Washington to determine it was Myoepithelial Carcinoma. They later performed a PET scan, where the tumor along with a nearby lymph node “lit up” signifying the strong possibility that the cancer had spread. On September 1, 2021, Christian underwent surgery to remove the lymph node for biopsy. The lymph node was much deeper than originally anticipated, resulting in a lot more pain afterward. The doctors had to install a drainage tube at the incision point, which was removed a week later. The biopsy of the lymph node confirmed that it too to contained the MC cancer cells, which meant the cancer had spread into his lymphatic system and now has greater potential to spread further.  How you can pray for Christian: As believers, we recognize God as the ultimate healer. He is the only one we can trust in for healing Would you pray with us, for God to heal Christian of this cancer, whether it be by miraculous means or through some sort of medicine or treatment, or both. Pray for God to strengthen and sustain Christian’s faith through the valleys and mountain tops of this life challenge. Our prayer is that his faith and this journey would be an encouragement to others and would help to draw others to Christ. Pray for his comfort and the comfort of his family that they may rest in the promises of God.

We took a chance and it's worked out really well. Columbia is simply a fabulous small town. We have met a lot of great people while we have been here through my teaching and coaching at Columbia High School along with all of the fantastic events this community puts on. One of those really great people is Officer Mike Conrad. He has been my neighbor for the last 9.5 years. He is just one of those guys who would basically give you the shirt off his back if you asked for it. Mike and I have talked sports, carried very heavy items in and out of both of our houses, spread mulch, and sat in our driveways on nice summer and fall nights, etc. He is the best neighbor anyone could have. After meeting Mike and getting to know him better over the years - I understand he also acts the same exact way in the community. He has lived in Columbia his entire life and has given so much to the community. He is an active member of the ICS church and school. He is also a very well respected police officer in town. All of the police and fire department members I talked to describe him as ""caring, by the book, organized, committed, loves his hometown, would do anything for you, and is the ideal community member."" Well, sometimes life is unfair. As Mike told me the other day, ""life has dealt me a bad poker hand and I'm going to fight like heck to get through it"". Unfortunately, Mike was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago. However, cancer doesn't know the fight, it just got into Mike ""Muscles"" Conrad. With your help, I also don't think cancer knows what type of fight it got into with the great community of Columbia either. I'm hoping you can come out and support Mike on November 8th at Immaculate Conception School. Both the 8th grade girls and boys basketball from ICS will be playing the Columbia Middle School teams. I think this is a great opportunity for this small town to support one of their life long community members, a tremendous police officer, loyal church and school member, and my great friend and neighbor - Mike Conrad. If you can't make the game - I have also set-up a GoFundMe to help Mike offset the costs of his cancer treatments. Please consider giving whatever you can to support Mike.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/we-need-your-help-for-tara-and-baby-amun,We need your help for Tara and Baby Amun," My name is Emily, I am fundraising on behalf of my friend and Co-worker Tara, her boyfriend Hasan and their 3 month old baby girl, Amun. (Pronounced A-moon) I am reaching out to you all, with a very detailed description of what they are experiencing in hopes Tara and Hasan aren’t going to be bombarded with a plethora of questions even they don’t exactly have answers to, but also in hopes that we can provide them some financial assistance to aid them through this medical anomaly. Amun is the first child and as many parents have experienced before them, life with their new baby hasn't exactly gone as planned. Amun was born with an unidentify motility disorder preventing her from properly being able to release waste. AKA she can’t poop on her own, thus causing her become extremely constipated and very (concerning-ly & uncomfortably) distended. Amun has been to several Doctors appointments and her parents were given a few tips/tools to use at home to assist and comfort their baby, ultimately however it just wasn’t enough. At 6 weeks old she was rushed to the ER at Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital. They were admitted and stayed a little over a week while the Doctors and nursing staff did what they could to help get things moving. Once they felt she was in a more manageable state the family was discharged. They were asked to follow strict diet and feeding changes for both the mommy and baby, paired with many scheduled follow up appointments to continue to search for the problem/solution. Things seemed to be going well for about a month when suddenly the problem came back only this time; much more aggressively. On October 6th they found themselves checking back into Mary Bridge Children’s Hospital to seek immediate help. Amun had become noticeably lethargic, she was loosing weight rapidly and barely had an appetite, what she would eat always came back up. When they had gotten to the hospital things took a hard turn. Her body temperature had dropped to 94.3*, her heart rate was rapidly decreasing and her skin was a purple and grayish splotchy color. Upon immediate testing they were able to see she was severely dehydrated and her red blood cell count was running low as well. This was just one of the many scary scenes this family of 3 had stumbled upon over the last 3 1/2 weeks. Although they had been receiving fabulous and diligent care from the team at Mary Bridge, no one could seem to figure out what was causing these motility issues. They were able to confidently rule out a lot of the common issues through extensive and invasive testing but their bigger problem at that time was malnutrition. After several painfully failed attempts the IV team was finally able to successfully insert a PICC line that ran a tube up her thigh through a vain to her heart and draining into her tummy. This PICC line was used to provide Amun with a specially constructed fluid called TPN, which provided her body exactly what it need to maintain stability while on an NPO (meaning she was not allowed to eat anything by mouth). The TPN was administered through the PICC line and each bag lasted 24 hours. Until the 3rd night of TPN, the administering machine malfunctioned and completely drained an entire bag of TPN into her stomach in under an hour. Although being monitored very closely by the nursing crew and her mother, Tara, no one could foresee this happening. Amun showed several signs of discomfort to which each was reported by her mother but since her vitals were coming back normal at this point the nurse offered Tylenol, which Amun quickly threw back up. Highly concerned Tara asked to see the doctor. He didn’t come… after about 45 minutes of trying to comfort her baby to sleep swaddled tightly in her arms Tara realized her baby girl was having a seizure. Doctors and nurse ran to their aid which is when they discovered the TPN malfunction. Amun was taken to the ICU where they had discovered the overdose has cause her blood sugar to shoot well above 1200. For over an hour and a half Amun laid nearly life less and unresponsive seizing in the hospital bed. Amun’s recovery had only gotten trickier from there. They transferred to Seattle Children’s Hospital for specialized motility care and she has also been through even more extensive testing to follow her seizure such as being monitored by EEG for 24 hours but also an MRI, X-rays, Ultrasounds which located several blood clots, she has needed 3 blood transfusions, several blood draws for testing, medications and labs, daily irrigation, 8 enema’s and so much more. There are at least 60 different people working on her case and STILL NO ANSWERS!!!! Tara has spent every single day and night at the hospital with her daughter, missing over 5 weeks of work (not covered by maternity leave) while Hasan continues to work and care for their 2 dogs and home. Hasan spends his nights and weekends at the hospital with his ladies however now that they are placed in Seattle his visits are more limited. Amun has proven to be a very tough little girl and their journey is no where close to being over, as mentioned, the cause of her bowel issues has yet to found.  We (friends and family) are all heartbroken over what has happened. Please help Tara and her baby Amun, I think they have both been through enough already.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/mike-gordon-fundraiser,Mike Gordon fundraiser,"   In January of 2020, my best friend Mike Gordon and his wife Jennifer heard the news no family wants to hear: he was diagnosed with stage four colorectal cancer that had spread throughout his entire liver.   He immediately began chemotherapy,  and in July of 2020, he had a very extensive surgery to remove part of his liver. Because of the difficulty of that surgery, they weren’t able to get the colon section removed as was planned. But the doctors in Omaha thought the surgery went very well and felt that they had removed all of the tumors.  After a two month struggle with drain tubes preventing any ongoing treatments, the next PET scan showed that almost all of the cancer had returned to the liver. It was heartbreaking for him and his family. More treatments followed, but nothing else seemed to improve his condition. He also caught COVID which delayed treatments even more.   In early 2021 Mike went to The MAYO Clinic for a second opinion. The doctors there said his cancer was too far progressed for further surgery and would move him to palliative care. Their opinion was that he had about 1 year to live. His cancer is progressing quickly. He has problems eating and has become very weak. His liver is now starting to show signs of failure and his skin is jaundiced.    We fear Mike’s time is short and are asking for any monetary donations to help with his increasing medical expenses. He also has a dream of possibly taking his family on a short trip which they have never done before. As this is unlikely because of his health,  the money donated will be to help with expenses now and when he’s gone. Mike is a great man; he is a Veteran and has over 15 years with Volunteer Fire and ambulance services. I’m just asking for some good news or a little relief for Mike and his family who absolutely deserve it. Thank you for all the donations and prayers. God Bless. ",13395,30000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-lindsay-with-her-lung-transplant,Help support Lindsay with her Lung Transplant!," Lindsay and her family need our help.  Lindsay was born with a disease called Cystic Fibrosis.  For those of you who are not familiar with Cystic Fibrosis [CF], in short, it is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the digestive and respiratory system.  CF develops because of a defective gene that is on Chromosome 7, and it stops salt from moving in and out of the body’s cells effectively.  The result is an increased production of abnormally thick and sticky mucus, which clogs the airways and digestive system. The clogging of these systems causes severe problems with breathing and bacterial infections in the lungs.  These infections cause chronic coughing, wheezing, and inflammation.   Lindsay has battled CF for all of her 32 years. She takes daily medications such as pancreatic enzymes to help her digestive system and utilizes nebulizer treatments in order to increase the function of her lungs. In addition to her daily at-home treatments, over the past decade, Lindsay has had to spend a minimum of 2 weeks in the hospital each year as her lungs required more aggressive care. The last six years for Lindsay has meant 8 PICC lines, a port inserted in her chest, and multiple surgeries to remove nasal polyps and infections in her sinuses because her airways were restricted. All while working and raising a toddler! The exhaustion from this disease and the invasiveness of the treatments finally caught up with her two years ago, and she had to give up working in order to conserve her strength.  On October 1st, 2021, Lindsay’s condition worsened suddenly.  She was home with her partner (Anthony) and 3-year-old daughter Brynn when she was afflicted with a coughing episode. Though Lindsay has been coughing up small amounts of blood for the past 2 years, this time she had a massive hemoptysis.  It was evident this was not “normal” and had to be rushed by ambulance to the hospital.  She had scans, a blood transfusion, and endured a procedure to embolize some of her blood vessels, with the hopes to stop the bleeding in her lungs. For the following 10 days, Lindsay remained in the hospital to be closely monitored and to continue her IV antibiotics. On October 11, 2021, Lindsay was discharged and very excited to go home to her family.   Unfortunately, within minutes of being home Lindsay had another hemoptysis episode. Once again, she was rushed to the hospital by ambulance.  After additional scans, it was determined a bronchoscopy would be necessary in order to get better visualization of her airways. This was followed by another embolization procedure to get the bleeding under control.  Thankfully these procedures were successful; however, they provide only a short-term respite.  After 32 years of diligent care, Lindsay’s lungs are no longer in a manageable state, and the only option for survival is a lung transplant. Fiercely independent, Lindsay has always handled the obstacles with her health with impressive strength and mental fortitude. It is not in her nature to ask for help, but this is not a solo journey anymore; Lindsay is a mother to a beautiful little girl, Brynn, who needs her mom. And what Lindsay needs is time. New lungs are the only way time can be granted. So, she needs our help. All donations will pay for medical bills, treatments, and other expenses such as transportation and housing. Once Lindsay has the strength to endure the procedure, she will get a double lung transplant in Boston. She will have to stay within 10 minutes of the hospital for up to 6 months post-transplant for close monitoring.  She needs our support now more than ever.  Every little bit helps and is greatly appreciated!  ",35920,50000,6 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/dominics-heart-surgery,Dominic’s ❤️‍ Heart ⚕️ Surgery," My name is Tara LiCastro.  I am fundraising for my son Dominic’s heart valve replacement surgery. Dominic’s congenital heart defect was detected almost a decade ago when he was still in elementary school.  This finding made so much more sense of the fact that one male from each preceding generation of our family was taken from us far too soon in their 40s due to heart failure. However, our family took some comfort in his physician’s assumption that Dominic’s leaky aortic valve would not cause him significant trouble nor require replacement until at least 40, 50 or 60 if ever, taking into account that he is a disciplined athlete, doesn’t smoke, nor drink alcohol excessively, and enjoys a healthy diet. I wondered if perhaps contracting CoVid on campus somehow contributed to the rapid degeneration of the valve that resulted in such severe regurgitation or brought on the hypertension, and all of the associated problems and risks that can come along with it such as aneurisms or further enlargement of the heart and arteries, but that is highly unlikely, so we do not understand precisely why or how it became so bad so unexpectedly soon that this surgery is necessary before he even reaches 20. As scary as this is and as difficult as it has made it for Dominic to get out of bed, much less work or participate in his college classes and coursework this semester, we are beyond thankful that at Dominic’s prompting, his cardiologists recognized the urgency and therefore moved very quickly to order the necessary tests and expedite him in for surgery so that his life might not only be saved but prolonged before more damage is done and also that he can get back to fully living. As a widow on a teacher’s salary striving to support our four children through college and into the career world, regrettably I cannot afford to pay for their room and board nor any of the other fees that their scholarships will not cover.  Likewise, we are hoping that Dominic will not lose his scholarship due to having to drop the remainder of this semester in order to recover from heart surgery. His dream has long been to make it into and through medical school and himself perform life-saving surgeries someday. Although  that will be much more difficult to achieve with mounting medical bills coupled with his inability to work to earn money or attend classes until his heart is repaired and fully recovered from the surgery, we are not giving up on his aspirations.For these reasons, we humbly ask for any form of support you can extend to help carry our darling Dominic through this difficult time until he can carry himself and pay it forward by positively impacting the lives of so many as he has always been compelled to do.

My name is Larisa, and my story begins with an ordinary visit to my dentist, who spotted a suspicious growth in the back of my mouth. At this moment, I never imagined something so small and insignificant at that time, would turn into the biggest nightmare of my entire life. First, it started with was an extensive 10-hour long surgery for the removal of the cancerous tumor. Followed by metastases in both of my lungs. Eventually, the spread continued to my spine and other organs in my body. This has all been a very long and painful 7-year journey that just doesn’t seem to end. Unfortunately, the treatments that I have been receiving with my health insurance has only kept me afloat and some of these experimental treatments have only worsen my condition. I’ve tried everything from natural remedies, diets and of course numerous doctors, hospitals, with no luck. My health is getting worse day by day, and I feel like I am deteriorating in front of my family ‘s eyes, which is more painful than the cancer itself. I have lost my job but still optimistic, and I really want to live to see my children grow and continue to be there for them with my husband. I am only 39 years old, and I am not ready to let go; I really want another chance to live my life and see my beloved sons to get married. My entire family is heartbroken seeing me suffer and I am heartbroken for them since I know that they are trying their best to support me and be there for me. Despite all of this, we all still have faith and believe in miracles. My family went through extensive research and found a highly recommended private oncology clinic in the state of Texas, through a friend who had personally been through similar situation and survived thanks to them. Unfortunately, this clinic does not accept health insurance and they also don’t offer any payment plans; I was quoted $30,000 per month in medical bills for the period of 6 months to 1 year to see results. Please help me with a chance to live and bring a smile to both my children and husband, they have been suffering for too long and it breaks my heart. Please know that I would do the same for anybody who is fighting for their life, and no one can understand that better than I when you are faced with an awful situation like this.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/love-and-support-for-rob-kris-cook,Love and support for Rob & Kris Cook,"Morgan Cook is organizing this fundraiser. To Our Family and Friends, It is unfortunate that we have been led to this moment but the time we have left is too valuable, especially right now. Our dad Rob Cook has Stage 4 melanoma. The cancer has spread throughout his brain and into his lungs. Since May 2021, my sister Allison Tarr, my brother Austin Cook, and I (Morgan Cook), have rallied alongside our parents as they navigate the diagnosis, the different treatments, the side effects, the reality, and the heartache of cancer. We will take every bit of hope, love, and prayer you can share. It is no surprise, our parents faith is unshaken. Our mom Kris Cook reminds us to dig deeper into our faith as our dad’s health declines and as our hearts become heavier. We ask all of you to do the same. We are asking you to pray relentlessly for our dad’s healing and for our mom’s strength. Our mom is tirelessly devoted. Her compassion and advocacy for our dad is an example of true love. She has poured every moment, every breath, and every ounce of energy into caring for our dad. And she will not stop. Our dad is coming home this week. After months of treatment and more than a month in the hospital, our dad will return home. While we are relieved to have our parents downstate again, I’m sobbing as I type… I know what this means and, frankly, I’m just not ready. None of us are. Our parents need more than just our support right now. Our dad hasn’t worked in months. Our mom is still working when she can. She is our dads caretaker and she is doing an amazing job. Austin, Allison, and I are calling on our community to help us ease our parents stress and relieve some of the burdens right now. There are medical bills, the demands of everyday life, and the loss of income to consider. We can’t change or slow time. But we hope this will afford our mom the gift of time and a bit of peace. We hope she can stop working to focus every minute left on being with our dad. We hope, during this time, our mom will not have to worry about bills. We hope this will raise money for our mom and perhaps a miracle for our dad. Your generosity is requested but your prayer is needed. With Peace, Love, and Hope..

As we all know, one of our beloved friends, co-worker, and family member has been in an ongoing battle with Stage 4 Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. The type of Lymphoma he has is only ""curable"" by stem cell transplant; otherwise it's terminal. The latest news is that the transplant he was scheduled to have in November, has been postponed due to a rare kidney disease. The kidney disease places him at a strong risk for kidney failure, if not treated immediately. This will be the second time his transplant has been pushed back due to health complications.The Safarik family is so grateful for all the check-ins, donations, and meals that have been provided in the past. Let's keep the support going for this strong family. If able, please donate to help with the financial burden of these hefty medical bills, gas from trips to the hospital for treatments, as well as meals along the way.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/harris-hammer,The Harris Hammer,"Adam Freier is organizing this fundraiser. If you are part of the Rugby family and sporting landscape in Australia, you would know Tony Harris. Tony has run the home Wallaby test match operations almost as many times Michael Hooper has on home turf! For every home test, he managed the show. Nobody would argue that! This year, Tony made the difficult decision to amputate his right leg, due to life threatening vascular disease, which could have resulted in Tony dying. He did it to show his kids he was brave, and that he would never risk the chance of not seeing them grow. Ton is in for a marathon of a recovery, so I thought I would run the 42km LA Marathon on the 20th of March 2022 and ask for your support in The Harris Hammer. Many would know my lactic tolerance by my facial expressions and body language in the first 10 minutes of a rugby match, but 4 hours of pain is the least I can do for this guy. He never asked for this, but he will need our support. From his rehabilitation, equipment, time of work or just ensuring he and his wife can get away from their four kids on date night. He is a great husband, father, mate and LEGEND and epitomizes all aspects of being a GOOD BLOKE who will go on an inspire us all. Donate $21 if you think I will only make it halfway, $42 if you think I will finish, $100 if you think I will tear a calf pre or during, or as much you think will help Tony (and make me run under 4 hours!) I believe in the Rugby community always supporting its own, so thanks for getting behind The Harris Hammer. ",16698,20000,15-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-garnel-battle-stage-4-pancreatic-cancer,Help Garnel battle Stage 4 pancreatic cancer," GARNEL MILLER There are times in your life when you know you have met someone that is truly special. I have met such a man – his name is GARNEL.  Over the last 5 Years I have had the pleasure of working with GARNEL at the “Ocean City Coffee Company” – where he is truly loved by all our Staff/Owners. He and I immediately developed a great working relationship, and I am now proud to call GARNEL my Friend. So, what exactly makes this man so special – for starters he works harder than any man I know – his work ethic is unchallengeable - he works as many as 3 or 4 different jobs in a day so he can provide for his adopted family.  GARNEL cares about each one of them more than he cares about himself. His partner in life has recently become ill with something that the Doctors and Specialists are just unable to determine the cause her such pain. But GARNEL has remained by her side thru all the testing and hospital stays while continuing to work when other men would have simply left.  GARNEL is a man of character that is willing to help others that are often in less need than he himself.  So exactly why am I writing about GARNEL today. Well, my friends, GARNEL now needs each one of us to “HELP” him. Several weeks ago, GARNEL was diagnosed with Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer. He came to me to tell me about this news.  He had no tears in his eyes and instead of being focused on what he now needed to do his biggest concern was still with his Partner in Life.  Knowing he was soon to be unable to work he just did not know how he was going to financially care for those he loves most. In hopes of minimizing that concern I have set up this “GO-FUND-ME” Account in order to provide the financial support GARNEL needs while he is working to beat this Cancer. Knowing GARNEL as well as I do, I am certain he would not be happy with me asking for help in his behalf and in this fashion.  But this FINANCIAL SUPPORT along with our PRAYERS will bring GARNEL back to us all again. This “World” is a better place because of GARNEL and with your “PLEDGE” and God’s help we will have the GARNEL back we all so love and adore.  His parting words the day he told me of his Cancer was simply “HE WAS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO BEAT THIS CANCER AND HE WAS GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS AN EVEN BETTER MAN”.  Never once did GARNEL ask why this hardship had fallen on him – instead he his focus remains on the needs of others.    Please consider helping this man if not with money simply with your prayers. I know no one more deserving than GARNEL. GARNEL would gladly give you the shirt of his back if he thought it would help you. Please open your HEART in his time of need.  THANK YOU and now please take the time to read one of the “Owners”,  of the “Ocean City Coffee Company”, comments regarding this “Great Man”, Garnel Miller Son, Husband, Father, Step Father, Grandfather, Friend Garnel Miller is an exceptional person.  I do not say this about many people. Very few, in fact. Our society is full of self-centered, or perhaps, more kindly, self-obsessed individuals. You see it every day. The self-promoters, the lack of integrity and honor. It has been my privilege to have known Garnel for over 15 years. During that time, I have seen him consistently put his family’s. and others’, needs first. Sacrificing his convenience and desires to use his time and resources to benefit others. To be perfectly clear, he is the finest person I have had the good fortune to call my friend. Now Garnel can use our help. Diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer, he needs a safety net to see him through treatments to battle the disease. No one deserves it more. If you have met him, you have felt his radiantly positive spirit.  We hope you can find it in your heart to contribute, and reward a truly altruistic life lived with honor, integrity, compassion, and love. Thank you for your time. God Bless. ",13346,20000,21-Oct-21

I am a professional skateboarder, and I am making this fundraiser in order to raise funds for a pending surgery and all of the financial hardships that will come afterwards. As a professional skater, my job is very high risk, and injury is almost inevitable. While filming for a new video part, I injured my knee, tore my meniscus, and I’m going to need minor surgery to repair it. I will also require physical therapy after the surgery and will be out of work for a few months until I get back on my board and get back to business.  Unfortunately, I have to pay out of pocket for the surgery and physical therapy, creating a financial hardship for our family. I hope to raise funds to help us take care of the surgery and recovery, as well as any other financial difficulties related to our monthly needs while I am off work. Your contributions and donations are greatly appreciated and will not go unnoticed! I plan to return the favor to anyone and everyone that helps us along the way in any way I can to let everybody know we are truly grateful and appreciate your generosity.  ",21505,20000,4 days

It has now been over a month.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-al-delvecchios-fight-with-glioblastoma,Help Al Del Vecchio’s fight with Glioblastoma," Calling all prayer warriors and our wonderful community! The Delvecchio family needs our help the most right now!  After Al’s surgery, about two months ago, he was given the option of receiving treatment in the form of Chemo and Radiation therapy with the hope of shrinking any residual tumor and hopefully preventing or delaying any relapse in tumor growth. Al elected to not undergo any treatment. Several weeks ago, Al’s condition rapidly deteriorated. It is believed that a combination of the numerous medications that he is taking has contributed to a decline in cognitive function and motor skills.  As a result, he has been primarily in bed.  Al’s wife Lisa, in consultation with the home health care nurse, has been carefully making changes to Al’s medication regimen. As a result, there has been some recent positive indication that these adjustments are helping with some of the symptoms. Time will tell and, in the meantime, the family and close friends that are with Al daily are remaining positive. As some of you may be aware, Al and Lisa's youngest son John suffered an anoxic brain injury due to a drug overdose back in February of 2019. As a result of John's condition, Al and Lisa decided to move John home so they could provide the type of full-time care that he requires.  Lisa kept her full-time job which meant that Al provided the bulk of the care to John, this is ongoing intensive 24/7 care. Due to Al’s condition, he is now unable to care for John which means that Lisa has continued, almost exclusively, being John's full-time caregiver. The type of care that John needs is at times very technical and outside the scope that family and friends can provide. This means that Lisa is unable to spend any meaningful time caring and providing for Al. So, I am about to ask you all for some money, and as much as you can afford to spend. Al and Lisa had previously hired a home healthcare nurse to help them out with caring for John. The nurse charges $20/hr. and has been staying one night a week at the house.  When the nurse is not there, Lisa must assume the role.  The care is literally so intensive that whoever is caring for John can’t be more than a few feet away from him at all times. Our goal right now is to raise enough money to hire the nurse to be there as often as she can, so Lisa can be with Al.  $200 buys Lisa a full night to be with Al. Quite a bit of money was raised recently in the GoFundMe campaign that was set up by a friend at Reno PD.  Al and the entire family have been immensely grateful for the outpouring of support that they received. Lisa has been faithfully and carefully stewarding that money in a way to stretch it and make it last as long as possible, however expenses continue to mount. In addition to Al’s current battle, Lisa is surviving on very little sleep, usually 2 – 3 hrs. per night and that is typically broken up as she is up throughout the night with John. This is not sustainable.  In addition to a Zelle account that has been already set up. Either option (or both) would be greatly appreciated by the family.  However, if you need to pick one, I encourage as many people as possible to consider donating to the Zelle account.  The benefit to this account is that the donor can elect a one-time gift, or better yet they can elect to make smaller re-occurring donations.  The re-occurring donations would be invaluable to the family as we are all hunkering down and preparing ourselves to stand with the Del Vecchio’s as long as needed.  As a reminder, $200 buys Lisa a night to spend with Al, or resting, which she desperately needs right now. Whatever you can afford, everything is helpful!  Thank you all for your continued love and support. Keep those prayers coming!  ",16970,50000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jeff-thompson-as-he-battles-als,Help Jeff Thompson as he battles ALS!,"Ann Seymour is organizing this fundraiser. As some of you know, our dear friend, Jeff Thompson, recently received the shocking and life altering diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. This tragic diagnosis has been devastating for Jeff, his wife, Susan, their son, Eric, and their extended family and close friends. At present, there are no treatments that can permanently halt the progression of the disease and there is no cure. Jeff and Susan learned of the diagnosis after he underwent testing for symptoms that were interfering with his ability to do his carpentry job. A few weeks later, they met with medical professionals at the ALS center where he is now a patient. At the center, they learned that it would be very beneficial for Jeff’s overall health if he stopped working. So he did and is now on short term disability. Given the symptoms he is already experiencing, he will never be able to work full time again. Depending on the progression of the disease, he may never work again, period. While Jeff and Susan have health insurance, finances will be stretched beyond the limit because (both surprisingly and disappointingly) health insurance covers little in the way of medicine, equipment, and palliative care needed for ALS patients. Adding to their burden, Susan is also on disability because of her blindness and her own health issues. This GoFundMe campaign has been created to rally support for Jeff and Susan and to relieve as much financial stress for them as possible. When hearing of a friend or loved one facing a life changing situation, people often ask, “what can I do?” To quote Edward Everett Hale, a prominent Boston Unitarian minister, “I am only one but I am one. I cannot do everything but I can do something. And I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do. If you know Jeff, you know he is one of the kindest, most compassionate, and generous people on the planet and a devoted son, husband, father, and friend. He is always willing to go out of his way to help others, but never comfortable asking for help in return. But help him we must. Now is the time to “do something” by supporting this effort. Making a donation, in whatever amount feels comfortable, will make an enormous difference to Jeff and his family as they start to navigate this new and utterly terrifying reality. This disease is as insidious as they come. For all the millions of dollars raised in the 2014 Ice Bucket Challenge ($220 million worldwide), little progress has been made in finding effective treatments, let alone a cure. So, while scientists struggle to beat this beast of a disease to the ground, help us help Jeff and Susan by relieving some of their financial burden and anxiety. Thank you so much for opening your heart and donating to this effort. Your support means the world to Jeff, Susan, and Eric and is beyond appreciated. ",44176,50000,10-Oct-21

Since then she has been courageously fighting an uphill battle; traveling back and forth to treatments in Columbus, OH with her husband, Mike, and their pup, Copper - occasionally for days at a time. She most recently left home on October 3rd for what was expected to be an intense five days of treatments. Unfortunately, instead of returning home on the fifth day, she was admitted to the ICU.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/pauls-comeback-road-to-recovery,Paul’s Comeback & Road to Recovery," On Friday October 22 Paul was hard at work as the General Manager at Condado Tacos when he suffered a Type A Aortic Dissection, which is a tear in the part of the aorta where it exits the heart. In Paul’s case, the tear occurred in the upper aorta which extended into his abdomen and down to his legs. After a 6 1/2 hour extensive surgery with a heart surgeon and vascular surgeon, his aorta was repaired with a graft and a bypass was created to re-establish blood flow to both of his legs. They had to create fasciotomies in both legs, which are incisions to allow for swelling of the muscle. He may need additional surgery to close these with a skin graft. Thanks to the amazing doctors and surgeons his surgery was successful. Paul is now in the ICU dealing with various complications as he begins his long recovery. He remains on a ventilator at this time, but is making slow progress. Paul is expected to be in the ICU for 2 weeks and then hopefully progress to a step down unit, and then move onto rehabilitation. Paul has worked in the restaurant industry for 25+ years and has a heart for running restaurants and for the people that work with him. Paul met his wife Dawn 15 years ago at a restaurant, where they worked together and have been married for almost 12 years, Their daughter Lucianna (Lucy) is 9 years old and is a true daddy’s girl. Paul affectionately calls her his “peanut” and often refers to Dawn & Lucy as “his girls”. Despite Paul’s long working hours, he’s never missed a special event or activity in Lucy’s life, which is a testament to the wonderful man and father he is. Dawn often says that her “Paulie” is the most loving, giving, quick-witted, and hard working man she’s met who makes her laugh everyday and has a heart of gold! Although both Paul & Dawn’s employers are supportive, while Paul is recovering and Dawn is caring for him they will have no income coming in. We would like to support them and give them peace of mind to make ends meet and help pay for medical expenses while they’re dealing with this serious medical emergency.

The goal is to help pay for mounting medical bills and being unable to work for an extensive time.  Early in September John woke with debilitating pain, unable to get out of bed, he was rushed to the ER. The diagnosis was devastating; testicular cancer. He underwent critical surgery immediately. Soon after John was informed that the cancer had not been eradicated, spreading further into lymph nodes in his abdomen. He's now about to begin Chemotherapy starting November 1st. Even with health insurance, navigating the system has proven difficult. Many of the procedures and visits that his insurance set him up are now unfortunately“not in his network”. Needless to say the bills are stacking up, and he faces months of not being able to work. Regardless of the difficult circumstances, we are confident John is gonna pull through! The support system of his friends and family have been tremendous. It’s obvious how many people John has touched and reached in such a positive way. I’m looking forward to having him back at the recording studio where we work, making me laugh, sharing his incredible talent to write and perform music (live and the recording studio), cook his amazing meals, and continue to touch us all with the authentic light and love that he gives so purely. Simply put, he makes every room he walks into a better, more fun place to be.

We are fundraising for our dear friend Blair Hansen and her family as they prepare for her upcoming surgeries to remove the cancer that has returned to her mouth and neck. Blair is mother to two girls, Smokey Rose, age 7, and Frances, age (almost) 9, and partner to her husband Eli Hansen. These funds will go to helping Blair and her family during the preparation for and recovery from this major surgery.For two decades, Blair has been a central voice and thinker in contemporary art, and a great and super supportive friend to many in our community. For the last 6 years, she and Eli have been operating a small hand-blown glassware business, Asp & Hand, in Washington State, where they live. With the return of the disease, Blair has to step away from that work. The funds raised here will help Blair focus on her recovery and help her take care of her family. In Blair’s own words: “In 2016, after tracking “precancer” for six years, I was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma and had a major surgery and a course of radiation to remove cancer from my mouth/neck. In 2020, I had a minor surgery to remove a recurrence of carcinoma from my tongue. And now, in 2021, the cancer is back in my tongue, but to a greater extent, by my tonsil/soft palette. In order to try to preserve my speech and swallowing function, I will have a transplant surgery and a lot of work to do in recovery. The doctors feel positive about the self-contained-ness of these recurrences, but it is disconcerting that the cancer seems to keep coming back. Chemo is not very helpful for my kind of cancer, and I can’t have any more radiation, so surgery is the only tool in the Western Medical Toolkit. Fortunately, Seattle has very strong cancer treatment teams, and I am confident that I will receive excellent care.” Eli will continue running Asp & Hand during this time, and purchases of their beautiful glassware is another excellent way to help Blair and her family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-dumas-family-fight,Help the Dumas Family Fight!,"Heather Klinter is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jennifer Dumas. I'm raising money to help my sister's family as Bryan continues to fight the hardest battle of his life. Bryan's battle with COVID has been brutally swift - especially for someone without any pre-existing conditions. He had been experiencing debilitating symptoms for a few days, but when it became hard to breathe he went to the emergency room (October 9, 2021). It was confirmed that Bryan had COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. His oxygen saturation level was low so a supplemental flow of 4 liters of oxygen per minute was started. He was admitted to the hospital and started on antivirals, steroids, anticoagulants and monoclonal antibodies. On October 11th, after only 1.5 days of continued deterioration, Bryan was admitted to the ICU, sedated, paralyzed, and put on a ventilator. The flow of oxygen was increased to 40, 50, 60 and then 70 liters per minute. Unfortunately, Bryan's oxygen levels and overall condition did not improve after several days on the ventilator. Bryan then developed blood clots in his legs. On October 14th, Bryan underwent a procedure to break up a clot that had traveled to his lungs - the procedure was successful and the clot was broken up.  On October 17th, we learned that Bryan's kidneys are failing to filter the byproducts from the drugs the hospital is continuously giving him to save his life. Despite diuretics, Bryan is now undergoing dialysis to help with him with his renal function. The nurses think that Bryan can hear even though he's sedated so when Jenny visits him (everyday for as long as they let her), she talks to him about their son, their dogs, their friends, their extended family - anything that will remind him to keep fighting this monster illness with everything he has.Jen is a high school teacher at Legacy High School in Thornton, Colorado. She's been a teacher there for 20 years and has been a mother, mentor, teacher, friend, therapist, safety net, confidant, and advisor for countless teens and their families. If you know Jen at all, you know she is the most giving and compassionate woman with much more enthusiasm and love than her tiny body can express. She gives her heart and soul to her students and her community and couldn't imagine any other way of being. Her students are her greatest love in life outside of Bryan and their son, Ethan, and they have been wonderful with their efforts to keep her spirits up. Bryan is a substitute teacher so when he isn't working, he doesn't get paid. The road to recovery is going to long with good days and bad days (one step forward, two steps back). The medical bills and loss of income are going to be felt for a long time. Please help the Dumas family in this time of intense struggle and pain. Please keep them in your prayers. Your support means the world to us. Thank you! ",47728,50000,17-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/julia-magdei-avm-recovery-fund,Julia’s AVM Fight And brain Hemmorage Recovery,"Chris Newbold II is organizing this fundraiser. Our dearest Julia, “JuJu”, “Jules”, “Princess” is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. If you are blessed to know her, I’m sure you feel the same. Julia is a ball of life and light that touches everyone she knows. Julia is extremely gifted and talented. She has always been a straight A student taking several AP classes in her Junior year at San Benito High School. She was well on her way to reach her goal to go to a top university like Harvard, Stanford, or Yale. Passionate about being a leader and the wellbeing of the student body she was also involved with Class Office. She also loves music, dancing, writing, playing piano, art, sports, cooking, all of which she did extremely well. On Saturday September 18th 2021 all of that was taken away when tragedy struck and of our lives were changed forever. Julia was at her friend Kayla’s birthday party. Her head started hurting, she began slurring her words, lost movement on her right side, and lost consciousness. They attended to her immediately and called an ambulance to take her to Hazel Hawkins hospital in Hollister. There they did a CT scan and discovered a massive hemorrhage in the brain. She was then air lifted to Lucile Packard Stanford Children’s hospital. When she arrived at Stanford she was immediately brought into surgery where they removed the bone on the left side of the skull and removed the blood clot from the area that bled. She was diagnosed with having an AVM (Arteriovenous malformation) an entanglement of arteries and veins in the brain that have malformed and become entangled. When the pressure gets too high in the entanglement the vessels can rupture and bleed. It will still be a very long road of possible surgeries, angiograms, or radiations. We have a very long road ahead of us. Likely years long. Julia will need several more surgeries and medical procedures, lots of rehabilitation, medications, medical equipment, continued nursing care, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy and modifications to our home and life for her to be able to start to return to a life we can sustain. We are scared and overwhelmed by the financial impact this will have on us. Julia’s mom, dad, and stepdad will no longer be able to work as they have often worked 2 jobs just to support their family. If you find it in your heart, and are able to help us, words cannot express how much we appreciate it. We will pray every day that the blessing you have given us will be returned to you one day. We understand that not everyone that reads this message will be able to help financially and all we ask from you is that you continue to send us your love, support, and prayers and we will pray for your blessings as well. We love her so much. Thank you everyone for all of your love, prayers, and support. We definitely need them. We all know how much determination and strength this little girl has and have no doubt that she will get through this! We know that our little girl has some very special to offer this world and that getting through this will only make her strong. Please help us give our little angel that chance. We love you all.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-find-harold-housing,Help find Harold Housing!," This is our friend Harold and he has been a frequent visitor of Java Cats for several years now. He needs our help and we hope the Java Cats family (and beyond) can get behind us! Our friendship with Harold started from his occasional visits to ask for trash bags because he liked to keep his area where he stayed clean. His quick ""stop-ins"" for trashbags turned into afternoon hangouts after we began playing his favorite R&B songs in the shop when he came by. We've spent many afternoons since talking about life, getting to know his story, and jamming out to music. Harold hasn't lived an easy life on top of the many years of homelessness, so to watch him find so much joy listening to his favorite singers he hadn't heard in years always made us so happy. It's the little things for Harold! January 2021, Harold was at the cafe when he began to feel faint and thought he was having a heart attack. I called 911 and he was taken away by ambulance. About a month later, he came back to see us. He was diagnosed as diabetic and lost both of his legs the day he went to the hospital. We were so devastated. Harold had once again disappeared for a while and when he came to see us, he informed us he had been in the hospital because he had a stroke. He lost his ability to talk clearly and was struggling to hold his head up. We just sat together and cried. It was incredibly difficult to have spent so much time building a friendship and sharing stories, for us to no longer be able to communicate. He is able to write down sentences in a notebook he keeps on him, but it just isn't the same and it's obvious it makes him sad too. He still comes in to see us and we do whatever we can to help make his life a little easier, but he never asks for much. I can't stop thinking about how life is already so difficult being homeless in Atlanta, but losing both of your legs and ability to communicate is just unfathomable. He deserves better. I met with him this past weekend and asked if he would be comfortable if we shared part of his story in an effort to raise funds to provide a place to stay until we could help find more long-term housing. He was beyond thrilled and wrote in his notebook ""A-OK!"" I've been in touch with social workers who have advised that in order for him to not lose his ""homeless"" status so he can find long-term help, it would be best to get him into an extended stay hotel. From there, we can get him on waiting lists for low-income or grant-sponsored housing and wait it out. Since he is disabled and needs a wheelchair-accessible place to live, this process could take even longer. Our plan is to provide him with an extended stay from November until January and our hope is that by then he will be accepted into a program that can offer a more permanent living situation. Extended stay hotels around Atlanta for 3 months (after-tax) is around $6,500. Anything in addition to what we raise will allow us to also provide groceries, clothes, and whatever else he may need. Let's get Harold off of the streets before it gets too cold and into a place he can focus on recovering. I just want to provide him a break, if just for a few months, where he isn't worried about the day-to-day life of being homeless and disabled. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for helping our friend Harold! He plans to come by next weekend so I can update him on our fundraising efforts. After many years of experiencing for myself the love, support, and generosity of our followers, I am so confident that the Java Cats community can easily help us achieve this goal!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/fundraiser-for-lyla,Lyla's Lifesavers- CRPS Fundraiser,"Team fundraiserTracy Jane Weidel and 2 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Heather McCarty. Have you met Jerry? He can be a real jerk. Jerry is Lyla’s left leg. Until February of this year, Jerry didn’t need a name. But after a typical afternoon of baking with her mom, Lyla suddenly fell to the floor screaming in pain. Life since then has been anything but normal for this sweet 10-year-old. After many sleepless nights, doctor’s appointments, x-rays, painful tests, and blood work, Lyla was diagnosed with a rare disease called CRPS (Complex regional pain syndrome). Complex regional pain syndrome is a condition that causes pain and other symptoms. Scientists believe abnormal nerve functioning causes an overreaction to pain signals that the nervous system can’t shut off. This condition causes acute pain for Lyla, so much so that she loses sleep, misses school, and has even expressed the desire to not be alive anymore (this chronic disease has been dubbed the “suicide disease” by those who are afflicted). Lyla has been a trooper through the entire confusing and crazy roller coaster of her illness. Naming her leg Jerry is just one way Lyla’s been able to cope with this illness, but she needs our help. Lyla has been waiting months in agony to be approved for treatment at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, which has a program specializing in CRPS, and which her doctors agree will give her the best chance at a normal life. She finally received word that she was next on the wait list, but then her family received the crushing blow that their insurance will not cover the treatment. Heather and Derek, Lyla’s parents, have been fighting for over six weeks with the insurance company to no avail. Lyla can’t wait and needs this treatment now. CRPS is one of the most painful conditions that exist. It can reach 42 on a pain index that maxes out at 50 (to put that in perspective, Heather’s recent broken ankle ""only"" reached a max of 20 on that scale). Lyla describes her pain as burning shocks that, while focused on her left foot from the ankle down, can radiate all the way up her leg at times. It can feel like something scalding is touching her or that it is freezing to the point of stabbing. A blanket on her can cause significant discomfort. Shoes can be challenging to wear and keep on. Sometimes pants feel so uncomfortable she can't wear them. Lyla on most days will say that her typical pain level is about a 6 or 7 out of 10, and many days she stays on 8. Lyla’s grades have suffered, and more importantly, her mental health is deteriorating and she is losing hope. She is begging daily for help with the pain and to start treatment. Lyla’s parents are public servants. Her father, Derek, is a special education teacher. Her mother, Heather, works for a nonprofit that serves veterans who want to serve in their communities. They are both the most loving, caring, and giving people in our community, and they need our help. Let's do what we can to lift the pain for Lyla and get her the treatment she desperately needs. Let's kick Jerry to the curb. Describe the recommended treatment: Given her stagnation and the decrease in her mental health, the recommendation is that she needs to have intense treatment of desensitization in a setting that can provide training for her on how to manage the pain while doing this, that can provide coping strategies to apply to different situations, and can help build her ability to be in control of getting functional independence back. It would take a full approach to that-the physical, mental, emotional, and muscular. It also provides support and training for her family so that they are able to be prepared to continue with the structure and appropriate support when they are back home. This treatment is at Cincinnati Children's Hospital (https://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/service/p/pain/pain-management-center/pain-management-clinic) and will last a minimum of two weeks. At least one caregiver needs to be present at the treatments, which will mean temporarily being out of work and relocating to Cincinnati. The out-of-pocket cost for the treatment alone is $67,000. We are asking for slightly more to cover travel and accommodation costs, as well as the GoFundMe processing fees. Explain how quickly you need the funds: Lyla asks (and almost begs) at least twice a day every single day when can she start the program. Her grades are suffering. Her happiness is dwindling. Her light is fading. With the decrease in her mental health, her family and doctors feel strongly that the sooner Lyla can get the treatment, the better. Every day that she isn't getting the treatment in the program, she is losing hope that she will ever have the chance to get back to the things that she loves. This is extremely urgent. Tell how these funds will help your loved one: Not only will this get Heather and Derek closer to getting Lyla treatment in the program, but it will give her hope again.  About Lyla: • Her nickname is Toots. • She loves pigs so much that she wrote a persuasive letter to her subdivision trustees to ask them to change the regulations so that she could have a pet pig. • She loves soccer. • She wants to be a veterinarian. • She loves to bake and cook and has dreams of one day being on Kids Baking Championship. • She has a huge heart and is one of the most empathetic people- even when she is in so much pain, she is constantly checking on her family, her friends, and others. • She has named her affected leg Jerry. She says things like, ""Jerry is really terrible right now"" or, ""Jerry is really swollen"". ",47188,76000,29-Sep-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-georgys-recovery-from-brain-cancer,Help with Georgy's recovery from brain cancer," Hi, everyone. My sister, Georgy, was admitted to the ER on 9/27/21 to get evaluated for her chronic headaches, which had been getting increasingly more severe over the past 6 – 7 weeks. Given she is only 28 years old and extremely healthy, we couldn’t have imagined a scenario which was about to unfold. They performed a CT scan at the local hospital, which revealed that she has a tumor on the right side of her frontal lobe. Given the severity of the situation, she was immediately airlifted to the University of Pennsylvania Neurological intensive care unit, where she remained until her surgery to remove the tennis ball sized tumor, which took place on 9/30/21. Georgy experienced paralysis on the left side of her body immediately following the surgery, which we were told could happen. She was unable to walk for several days until she regained just enough ambulatory ability to stand and walk with the assistance of medical staff. She remained at Penn for several days until she was eventually moved to a rehab hospital where she received physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and other treatment. She was finally discharged and sent home on 10/20/21. Though she is home, she faces a challenging road ahead given the tumor was a grade 4 (most malignant) IDH mutation astrocytoma. She will be starting a 6-week treatment process with radiation in conjunction with 6-12 months of chemotherapy. After this time frame, she will be monitored periodically, and they will reassess whether additional rounds of chemo are necessary on a go forward basis. Out of an abundance of caution, they plan on retrieving eggs to bolster Georgy and Will's ability to have children as the radiation/chemo increases potential for infertility.  The oncologist has told Georgy to expect this tumor to reappear sometime in the future, though he could not say if it would be in 2 years, 10 years, etc. He just said it COULD come back in her brain, at some point.  While the support from friends and family has been overwhelming, we can’t help but anticipate the financial burden she is facing from the escalating and ongoing medical bills. Although Georgy has insurance through her employer, she will have quickly blown through her deductible and maximum out of pocket. On top of the medical bills from her airlift, hospital stay, procedure, etc. she will be out of work for an extended period of time recovering. Thank you, again, for all the love and support for our dear Georgy. If she could, she would come give each one of you a huge hug in appreciation for all the texts, calls, flowers, etc. She is looking forward to returning to what was supposed to be a normal life for a healthy, driven and soon to be married 28 year old. And from the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank you for your support and contributions to help defray Georgy’s financial burden caused by this horrible disease.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/8x62e8-avas-fight,Ava’s Fight," What we wouldn’t give to just fast forward to the end of this chapter in our family book…but we have been faced with one of the worst battles a family has to fight through. Ava is 14 years old. She has a beautiful soul with a smile and giggle that could make your heart burst. She is so sweet, so kind, empathetic, and loving. She is a beautiful teenager who loves her family, her beautiful long hair, her phone, and babies (she wants to have 5 babies when she grows up). Ava has a twin named Ana and they are inseparable. After what seems like an eternity of doctors appointments, we are now in Rochester, MN and the amazing doctors at Mayo Clinic have found non-operative and extensive tumors in Ava’s brain. After a brain surgery to biopsy tissue, we wait for the official word. The doctors already said that big word that NO ONE wants to hear…the word that feels impossible to type. From there we figure out what our new normal looks like while we get Ava better as we navigate appointments with Oncologists, Neurologists and more. We are overwhelmed and scared, but, we are ready to go to the ends of the earth to heal Ava. There is nothing we won’t do. We are only a week into this and everyone has been so amazing. We are surrounded by angels. People ask what they can do to help and the truth is we need your prayers, we need you to send love and light and all of the good energy our way. We need good news and we need to hear the stories with the good endings. As equally important as receiving that loving & healing energy is, we need donations to help ease the financial burden that goes along with helping our sweet Ava fight this. (Sasha Quijano-Edwards is Ava’s mother and is the beneficiary of this Go Fund Me.  Donations made at this time will cover a multitude of things from paying medical bills and all of the expenses that come along with getting Ava better—we are currently doctoring 10-12 hours away from our home in North Dakota. Lodging and food is a big expense at this time until we know where we will be for her doctoring.  We are also finding that we need so many new medical items for Ava including a wheelchair, wedge pillow so she upright when laying down, and more.) ",21444,100000,7 days

Due to the extent of his injuries, flight for life was called and he was taken to UW Hospital in Madison.  Upon arrival, he was heavily sedated and intubated. He lost a lot of blood, which they had to supplement. It is under control for the time being. He is neurologically stable for now but has a lot of serious injuries and fractures that include his right ankle, left knee, left femur, left hip, pelvis, right wrist, several ribs, sternum, sacrum, and several lumbar, thoracic, and cervical fractures. The tissue and muscle of his left leg is extremely damaged and it’s likely he’ll need a skin graft in the near future. He has minor damage to the carotid and vertebral arteries to his brain. His internal organs are badly bruised and being monitored. They moved him from the ER to the ICU late Friday night. He had his first of many surgeries Saturday on the left hip and femur related fractures. Post-surgery they turned the sedation off and took the intubation out. His wife Vanessa was able to see him. He was awake and able to talk a little, but in extreme pain. The medical teams caring for Josh are hoping some fractures will heal on their own, but the rest will require multiple surgeries followed by a long road of physical therapy and healing time.  He’s worried about a lot and needs to focus on himself by staying positive. He’s needing a lot of reassurance right now. If anyone knows Josh, you know there are two things that mean most to him…his family and hunting. He’s crushed that he will miss out on time with his family and time spent out in the woods for the upcoming hunting season during his road to recovery. He’s strong-willed and isn’t going to let this get him down without putting up a fight. Many of you have experienced his kind-hearted nature and his willingness at the drop of a hat to stop what he is doing and come to the aid of someone else. He cares about others so much and really needs an outpouring from everyone during this time. This is a lot to handle and process right now and extremely difficult for his wife Vanessa and his 4 young children (Aurora - 10, Anthony - 6, Norah – 2, and Rosalie – 4 months).  At this point unfortunately, we have no idea what his timeline looks like as far as getting out of the hospital, but we know it will be a long road of recovery with many medical bills to follow. Their only vehicle was the one Josh was driving at the time of the accident and he was the sole provider for their family. If you’re able to help in easing some of his and his family's worries and concerns, please help in any way you can through momentary donations or by sending meals or supplies to N1521 Pleasant Rd., Fort Atkinson, WI 53538. Even just sharing this to pass it along would be much appreciated. Thank you to you all for the support and kind words as our family navigates through this difficult time. Please keep Josh and his family in your prayers. “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-julie-recover-from-losing-greg,Help Julie recover from losing Greg," How do you encapsulate how one person changed your life forever in one post on a GoFundMe? Today, I find myself in that position. Today, we lost some one I personally, as well as many others, considered a teacher, a mentor, a friend, colleague, and parent. Greg Hatcher devoted his life to teaching art, writing, creating stories and comics, and creating safe spaces for kids who may have not had a place to go. He always told us kids as we were growing up that he’d never be rich in money, but he was rich in joy and happiness. Greg sacrificed so much and fought so hard to maintain arts in schools, providing opportunities for kids and teens to explore themselves as creators, to introduce them to professionals in the comic industry, to make sure every kid he taught knew that an adult cared for them. He and his wife, Julie, never questioned when one their “kids” needed support, going above and beyond to provide whatever they could… they both were like parents that many of us needed. I met Greg when I was eleven and struggling with figuring out who I was, my rocky homelife, and my own mental health. I am in my thirties now and looking back, there is so much I can thank Greg for teaching and supporting me as I became the person I am today, and there are many others who feel the same as one of the “kids,” the “Hatchlings,” and as friends and loved ones. There isn’t a person who knew Greg and Julie who have not felt like in at the very least, some small way, that they brought light into their life. For me, Greg’s presence was in many ways life changing. Greg didn’t have to be there for me, for anyone, but he was, and he never wavered. Greg’s wife, Julie, was the love of his life. Through thick and thin, their home was filled with love, laughter, books, and dreams. Together, Julie joined Greg in his pursuit of building programs for kids, providing a safe place, and being a safe person. You will never find anyone as sweet, kind, and nurturing as Julie. It doesn’t matter who you are or the life you walked, she is filled with grace and kindness. Together, they were inseparable, you didn’t think of Greg without Julie, nor Julie without Greg. I am not one for believing in soulmates, but, I make the exception for them. When it was found that Julie had cancer, Greg continued to teach but also took on more work to support his wife to make ends meet. Also being a Type 1 diabetic, Julie’s health and wellbeing has always been something that Greg advocated for. They made it through, with support from their community who loves them, and Julie won. Things were tight for them, but Greg was confident they would pull through, just as they have always done. …But then, Greg became sick. The pandemic had hit, and Greg was unable to teach due to quarantine. Greg was diagnosed with cancer and continued to support his wife and their home as a specialized driver while navigating the disability system to help Julie who is no longer able to work, and the medical system as Greg’s cancer kept him in and out of the ICU and hospital over the last year. I am forever grateful that, during one of the brief moments Greg was out of the hospital, he and Julie came to spend a day with me, to meet my child, their first baby “grand-nerd,” and once again, I watched Greg open the doors to the world he loved of comics, heroes, and stories as he bestowed books to my child, showing him each one, telling him all about them—many of which were Greg’s favorites growing up. He and Asher bonded over Aquaman, Tarzan, and the heroes that inspired all of us. This story is about a man who played such an important role to me, but this GoFundMe is for his wife, a surrogate mom to many, as she learns to live her life without the man she thought she would never live without. With Greg being the sole provider before his cancer worsened, Julie is left with medical bills from both of their fights with cancer, home bills (such as rent, food, self care), and costs for Greg to be laid to rest. This is for the woman who deserves every happiness, a woman who saved just as many lost kids as her husband did, a woman who taught kindness, forgiveness, and was always full of laughter. I want to take Julie’s pain away, to make sure that Greg's bride is taken care of, and in some way, I hope this helps take away the stress so that she can grieve her love in peace.

Nearly a decade ago, Elma left her nursing career to help a small private school in Panama City, Florida. In doing so she took a large pay cut, lost many of her health benefits and had to make an uncountable number of sacrifices along the way. She also brought with her a daughter whom I would come to love and eventually marry.               While I never appreciated it in high school, Elma filled practically every roll that the school couldn’t afford to fill. While her job would necessitate that she took on the bulk of administrative duties, she also served as a guidance counselor, substitute teacher, gym coach, school nurse, and liaison to universities and further education programs among other things. In retrospect, it’s astounding how easy she made it all look.                 On the 23rd of July 2021, Elma was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer during a routine checkup. Over the last few months, she has suffered the ravages of this disease undergoing chemotherapy alongside radiation treatment. Throughout all of it she has put every last ounce of energy she has into her family and the school. I think it’s time we give back to one of the most selfless souls I’ve encountered. Any small donation will help tremendously in helping Elma finally kick cancer out the door. Thankfully, she is coming to the end of her Chemo and radiation treatment, but that’s not the end of the obstacles she has to face. In the coming months, Elma has to pay for her surgeries as well as the second round of her Chemo. Lots of long stays in the hospital, expensive surgical procedures, and highly specialized medications mean she will have expenses piling up. We appreciate any help we can get!

Rob says eventually when he gets full arm and hand mobility back, he would like it to be outfitted with hand controls so he can drive to work. Most people in his situation might just give up, not Rob.

My sister just found out from a recent PET scan that she has a mass by her vocal cords. She was receiving care through Mosaic ENT in ST. Joseph, MO. After they discovered the mass, she was then referred on to see an ENT Surgeon at the University of Kansas Medical Center. They scheduled an appointment on October 28th for a procedure to do a biopsy. When the anesthesiologist placed in the breathing tube for surgery, he discovered that the mass was restricting her airway severely. A tracheotomy was performed because they knew that the swelling after the biopsy would completely restrict her airway. Upon waking up from surgery she was shocked to find they had placed a trachea in her neck. This caused a lot of anxiety, stress, and worry on her. Her first worry that she had communicated on the dry erase board was that she was supposed to work on Monday. We rushed to be by her side. She has an incredible support system through family and friends. She constantly worries about medical bills and we would like for her to have some relief in regards to her worry and stress as she needs time to heal. She will be out of work due to these medical problems. She works as an LPN at Mosaic Health Care and is the most caring and loving person that I know. She will have numerous visits with the doctors at KU medical center which will incur transportation costs for her. We are still awaiting biopsy test results in regards to the mass and what form of treatment will be performed to remove it.  She is in KU med center at this time and will have a 3-5 day hospital stay and then will need 24/7 care when released to go home. If you can find it in your heart to donate, we would be so grateful and I know it would take a lot of stress off of her.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-the-ambrosino-family,Help Support the Ambrosino Family,"Alexis Ambrosino is organizing this fundraiser. Hi,  My name is Alexis Ambrosino, Rob Ambrosino's niece.  As many of you know, on September 26th 2021, the Ambrosino family got the worst news imaginable- Rob had collapsed from a sudden and unexpected brain aneurysm when going to get ready for a gig later that day.  His wife, Kristina, found him in the bathroom and immediately called 911. The first responders did everything they could to figure out exactly what happened and to bring life back to Rob. The initial assumption is that he suffered from a heart attack and went into cardiac arrest, but it was not until he arrived at the hospital where our family started to get more answers. He was first transported to Newton Medical Center, where he was immediately admitted and put on a ventilator. After running many tests, the doctors came to the conclusion he had a brain aneurysm that was causing his brain to swell and bleed.  They were unsure if the brain bleed was a direct cause from collapsing in the shower, or if he had it to begin with, causing his brain to hemorrhage. The staff decided they were not properly equipped and medevaced my uncle via helicopter to Overlook Medical Center all the way in Summit NJ.   From there, he was admitted and went into surgery immediately in attempt to relieve the pressure on his brain, doing everything they could to save his life. As the surgery went on, they realized the brain was under a mass amount of stress for too long, leaving the medical staff with an impossible task of relaying the news to our family. After doing everything they could to save Rob, we received the news that still, no one can wrap their heads around- his brain suffered long enough and they could not find any brain activity. He was declared brain dead later that night.  After hours of shock, disbelief, and countless tears later, the family was faced with an unimaginable decision. To keep Rob on life-support or let him go be with his brother Greg and mother Carol. While trying to process this horrific new reality, Rob was on life-support for days to come. I do not know if this is a type of tragedy that you can find the reason and sense in. However, it is one where we were all forced to make our own sense of. For our family, that reason we created was that Rob was an organ donor. Did you know only 1% of organ donors can actually donate their organs? This is because there is preliminary criteria which my uncle qualified for both- to pass away in a hospital, and be on life-support. Wow. With no surprise, it was the legend of Rob that was able to do so. He was able to donate each and every one of his organs to a person in need. We take solace in the fact that he lives on in many other people.  We are still waiting on where all of his organs went, but so far we know the following:  His heart went to a 61 year old man, his liver went to a 53-year-old man,  and his kidneys went to two different people. I will post updates in here when I find out more. To know my Uncle was to know he lit up any room he walked in to. He was ALWAYS smiling, laughing, or cracking a joke no matter what kind of day he had. He was the kind of man that put others first. That is with no surprise him being a coach, teacher, and musician for the last 20+ years. Rob loved to teach others- and that was not only in their respective subject, sport, or instrument, but life in general. He truly had a way with words and knew exactly how to make others feel special. He was arguably the biggest part of any community he blessed us with- whether that be Sparta athletics, Dover athletics,  a respected and basically home-town famous musician, his kid's lives, being a loving husband... you name it, he touched every person's life in more ways than just the traditional role he was supposed to play.  Rob was so much more than just an amazing father, husband, brother, son, friend, coach, teacher, mentor, etc. He always made sure to go above and beyond to be a well-respected part of the community. ""The Mayor of Sparta"" as some like to call him, Rob knew someone no matter where he was and went out of his way to show them some love. To say Rob was known by many but loved by all is an understatement. He is truly a legend that will live on forever and for that, we will celebrate. We love you and will never stop missing you, but we will sing, dance, and love one another to honor your memory. Please shed some love to his wife Kristina, daughters Erika (20) and Lauren (17), and son Robbie (13) during this unimaginable time. As expected, they are left will a mass amount of medical bills from this tragedy on top of grieving the loss of their husband and father. Anything helps.  ",143848,150000,3-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-aubreys-family-as-she-battles-rare-disease,Help Aubrey's Family as She Battles Rare Disease,"December O'Sullivan is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Allison Osullivan. Aubrey is a beautiful 3-year-old girl and she has no idea why her body won't work the way it did at the start of this year. My name is December O'Sullivan, and my niece and her family need our help. No parents should ever have to watch their child suffer, knowing there is nothing that can be done. No sibling should be making their Christmas wish for their baby sister to regain her strength back, but this is what my brother's family is facing. At the start of 2021, Aubrey was a typical 2.5 year old who loved chasing her brothers, jumping on the trampoline, and dancing. She had met all milestones early and was strong and energetic. Then she suddenly walked with a limp. Before she had her referral to neurology, she began to rapidly deteriorate. By April she could no longer lift her left arm, by June she could not climb stairs, and by July she could no longer run. Her muscles are atrophying and losing strength. In a matter of months, Aubrey has lost neck control, the ability to stand on her own, to roll over, or to sit up by herself. As my brother and sister-in-law searched for answers, a muscle biopsy confirmed her diagnosis-Reducing Body Myopathy caused by a single missense mutation in her FHL1 gene. If Muscular Dystrophy is rare, than this disease is beyond ultra rare. There are only about 30 known cases in medical literature and of those, the number of patients who began having symptoms in early childhood is around 10. It has been impossible for her parents to watch as their only daughter loses her ambulation and even harder to understand that at the beginning of the year she was fully capable and loving life. There is very little funding for research of this disease, there is no available treatment, and there is no cure. As my brother and sister-in-law fight for research funding and search for answers to help Aubrey, they are facing costs that they never could have known to prepare for. In 6 months time, Aubrey has had 52 doctors appointments, 9 different specialists, over 50 IV placements, over 100 needle pokes, she has had 5 prescribed medications, 1 weekly chemo shot, 2 which take her immune system to nothing. She has had to deal with a 10lb weight gain on her tiny frame due to steroids. She has had over 70 hours of pt ot therapies, 11 IVIG infusions, 1 muscle biopsy, 4 MRIs, 3 Echocardiograms. Even when not at the hospital, this sweet girl gets stressed knowing she will have to go back again soon. They will have to move their family to a home that is ADA accessible and closer to doctors who specialize in the research of this gene. They will have to pay for renovations to widen doorways, open floorplans, and update their home to meet ADA standards to accommodate wheelchair use, and improve accessibility for in home physical and occupational therapies. They will need to buy a wheelchair accessible van, and home equipment that will allow daily life to be easier as now full-time caregivers. They are determined to find a way to give her a home built for her, where she will never feel left behind by not being able to go where her abled body brothers go, and where she will never feel like being wheelchair dependent is a burden to move around her home. Aubrey and her family do not deserve to be going through this. She has remained her happy, spirited self through it all. My hope is that with this GoFundMe, there will be one giant less stress on my family as they work to make this sweet girl comfortable. I want her to be able to keep her bright, sassy personality as she transitions from fully capable to fully dependent. I hope that this support will help ease the incredible burden my brother and his wife are facing. And I hope that someone,somewhere will hear what this poor baby is going through and will find a treatment to this horrible disease. Please help this family meet the growing financial demands while battling this rare disease and giving Aubrey the quality of life she needs and deserves. Insurance does not cover any of these costs, so any amount you contribute will make a huge difference for them. If monetary contributions are not an option, please consider sharing this page to help their family. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for anything you can do to help. ",15738,50000,19-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-kristine-mother-of-5-fight-cancer,"Help Kristine, Mother of 5, Fight Cancer!"," Hi, my name is Bernadette Roth and I am fundraising for my eldest sister, Kristine Nolan. Kristine and her husband Scott are the loving parents of 3, soon to be 5(!) beautiful children and expecting twin girls in January. In mid October we were rocked by the discovery of a 6cm tumor, which helped explained much of the pain Kristine was experiencing over the past couple months. A few days later it was confirmed: Kristine has been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer, at just 41 years old and 25 weeks pregnant with twins. Kristine has started chemotherapy treatment and is beginning this long journey, the fight to recovery. My sister is a strong woman, and she's a fighter. Kristine has remained positive and is looking forward to beating cancer, meeting the twins, and coming home to be mother, wife, sister -- Continuing to be an amazing example for myself and all her crazy siblings (there's 9 of us!) Her loving husband Scott is right by her side, juggling being a husband, father, medical advocate, and champion (bordering on superhero status!) We are asking for your thoughts, love, and prayers as we beg God for a miracle! While Kristine has to focus on her health and her unborn children, there's lots to handle. The family is also under financial stress with the loss of Kristine's income and Scott taking time off to care for the family. There's added medical bills (which will be significant and already are), there's gas and tolls (the hospital is in NJ while the family is in PA) and meals and childcare, school tuition, regular bills, and oh yes-- two more kids on the way! Please consider donating to help Kristine and the Nolan family make ends meet while they go through the biggest challenge of their lives. If you prefer to avoid the small payment processing fee of 2.9% and $0.30, please feel free to donate directly to Scott Nolan. Gift cards, meals, and new or gently used baby items or also appreciated. We were planning to celebrate with a baby shower, but was cancelled by this unfortunate news. Kristine has a baby registry on Amazon https://www.amazon.com/baby-reg/3VV936XWR00C8.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-for-telles-grandparents,Help for Telle's Grandparents," Hi, my name is Scott. I am Telle's dad and those are his grandparents in the photo with him. Mom is 83 and is currently in the hospital with COVID. She was sick for a couple of weeks before she finally agreed to go to the hospital on October 9 2021. She has been there since and there have already been a few times we thought she only had a few hours left. Thankfully, each time she rebounded slightly, but she's nowhere near out of danger yet. She's about to go to into the intensive care unit (ICU) and it looks like she has many weeks left in the hospital. That will be followed by a few weeks or months of recovery time. It will be probably be spring before she can take care of Dad and their house again. Dad is 84 and unable to care for himself. He lost a leg a few years ago and has trouble walking. He has had heart problems for decades, with various medications and procedures in recent years. That includes bypass surgery and a pacemaker. That pacemaker is almost dead now, so in a few weeks there will be another surgery to replace it. He has very little hearing left, so communication is very difficult. Complicating it all, he has stage five Parkinson's disease. Along with the tremors and muscular problems many of aware of, it also can affect cognitive functions as it has in Dad's case. Some say, ""He can learn sign language"" but the fact is he has neither the physical nor mental dexterity for such a task. He is living with me now (which is different, for both of us!) and when she is eventually discharged, Mom will be here as well. For how long? Hard to say. If it's spring before Mom is recovered enough to resume caring for herself, him, and their house, then spring. But it could be sooner, or it could be a lot later. We just don't know. Where are things now and why this page? The other day Dad decided to wash his hair in the sink. He forgot to take his hearing aids out and dropped one. The sink had an inch or so of water in it and so the aid was fully submerged. In soapy water. It died instantly. There is a repair option, but it costs as much as to simply replace it. They have only Medicare A & B, so hearing, dental, vision is not covered at all. With two hearing aids the communication wasn't great, but it was doable. With only one, however, it is not much better than none. And none requires breaking everything down to a few simple words, spoken slowly and as clearly as I can manage, with long pauses between, and many many repeats. New aids are needed. Getting Dad to and from his various appointments is a challenge for both of us. There is no way in or out of my house without navigating a half-dozen stairs. That is hard for a one-legged, Parkinson's crippled old man to do. I'd take him in his wheelchair, but I can't muscle him up/down the stairs. I currently allow an extra 20 minutes to get him out the door once he is ready to go. A ramp is needed. My vehicle is also not very good for transporting him. It is small and his muscles don't let him easily fold up into it. It would be better to use their truck. However, it needs a knock sensor and an intake air sensor, a brake job, and a new set of tires in order to be safe in rain and ice and snow. There is an urgent need for funds to: -- Replace hearing aids -- Have a ramp built -- Fix their truck I set the target for enough to do the above. If we are blessed with excess funds, then I will put them toward other things that now or will need to be fixed at their house, such as: -- A ramp at the front door of their house -- Replace standard toilets with taller handicap toilets -- Install grab bars and rails where needed -- Replace the standard tub with a walk-in tub -- Repair the 46-year-old roof that currently has six known leaks (a completely new roof would be the proper solution) There are many other medical expenses and repair bills, but these would be the initial targets. If we are even more blessed, then any funds that end up above and beyond the stated needs will go to further improve their circumstances by filling needs. Finally, should blessings overflow, then Telle will direct the excess to a worthy cause. I will turn this account over to Tyler (Telle) now so he can manage it. He is much more experienced with social media and crowdfunding stuff than I am. ",4805,10000,3 days

He is a thoughtful friend, beloved husband, and treasured community member. He is an advocate for all things Hawaiian and an all-around amazing person. If you know him, you have been inspired by his drive and passion for life.  This year (2021), Unko Hank was diagnosed with lung cancer.  He is currently undergoing tests and complementary treatment while his cancer treatment protocols are being determined by his primary care team. Unko Hank is in good spirits and has a positive outlook on his treatment and recovery.  He is taking a holistic approach to his care and is seeking out innovative treatments along with following his physician's recommendations. We are raising funds for Unko Hank to help cover the cost of medical care and any other needs that arise in the coming year. Current expenses include: working with an oncologist, traveling to Oahu for treatment, working with alternative health care providers, acupuncturists, herbalists, osteopaths, and naturopathic caregivers. Both Hank and his wife are on a fixed income and many of the treatments are not covered by insurance and or require a co-payment. Our hope is that this fundraiser is a way to relieve a small part of their burden during this time. Every donation is appreciated.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/8xutx-help-amy-beat-cancer,Help Amy Beat Cancer!," Dear Friends of Amy, We are writing to you about our dear friend who has done so much for others and has sacrificed so much to have the life she is leading today. She spent almost four years in Tanzania to bring home her beautiful son, Pray. She stood by her mother's side, as her mother, Diane, fought cancer only a few years ago and now she has been diagnosed with virtually the same disease--Stage 3 Colon Cancer. Amy starts her treatment journey the first week of November with chemotherapy. A port is being placed this week to ease the process. She will be on the same chemo protocol as her mother, FolFox. It is rigorous and frequent, with her being treated every other week, with a 2 hour infusion at the cancer center, and then home with a wearable pump. After 4 months of chemo, she will be switched to radiation 5 days a week and a low dose chemo pill each day. That will last 6 weeks. She will be given just shy of 3 months to recover after all of this, before she is scheduled for a major surgery. Her oncology and surgery team is planning this surgery for May. On top of all of this, Amy has always dreamed of having more children. Pray has talked about his future siblings since he was little. Due to the upcoming radiation treatment, she has been told that she will need to harvest and freeze her eggs immediately if that is to happen. This, as you can imagine, is another added expense, but one that anyone in their mid-thirties would seriously consider. Overall, for cancer and fertility treatments, insurance will cover some of these expenses, but definitely not all, given that she has a very high deductible and they will only cover in-network services. Our goal is to raise enough so that finances are not an added stress during this already very stressful time. We want Amy to be able to get the best treatment she can, prepare for a future where she could hopefully still have the chance of growing her family, and ease the burden that this will put on her and Pray during the next year. We all know and love Amy and know that she has always been the person that has helped us out, now it's our turn to help her. Please give what you can. Amy will be updating us on her journey, so that we can cheer her on, pray for her, and help her as much as we can during this extremely difficult time. With love and prayers for healing, Whitney, Stephanie, and Sarah  ",12687,15000,7 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/diagnosed-with-stage-iv-cancer-1-week-after-birth,Diagnosed with Stage IV Cancer 1 Week Postpartum," On October 9th, 2021 my husband and I welcomed our 3rd baby girl into this world - Naomi Marie. Labor was rough as she got stuck in the birth canal with a decreased heart rate. Luckily, as they were wheeling me into the room for a c-section, she was born with one more big push just in the nick of time. When she came out she wasn’t breathing and had to spend a few days in the NICU, but praise God she quickly recovered and we were released home together after 3 days in the hospital. She weighed 7lbs, 3oz and is perfect in every way. Exactly a week after she was born, I started having terrible pains in my abdomen and throwing up feces. I was rushed to the hospital where I was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer that has spread to my lungs and liver. To say it was a shock is an understatement. My pregnancy had been uncomplicated, apart from some constipation issues and pains that started getting worse around 35 weeks. Of course doctors just assumed this was normal pregnancy related symptoms, as did I. Other than that, I had no other warning signs. On October 17th, only hours after I was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed, I was rushed into emergency surgery to ensure my intestines didn’t rupture as I now have a large tumor totally blocking normal functions. They performed a colostomy, where I had part of my colon cut off and a poop bag attached to my stomach. The next steps are to start Chemo and other treatments and see how things progress from there. So we have a bit of a journey ahead, all while trying to take care of a newborn baby and our two other children, ages 6 and 4. Regardless of the diagnosis, I feel the hand of God all over me and all over this situation. It’s for sure not what I would have chosen, but through it all, I know God has a plan. He’s never failed me before and I know he won’t this time either, no matter the outcome. I’m standing in faith that His goodness will prevail. And I’m a fighter, so I don’t plan to take this sitting down so to speak. I will war in my spirit and in my flesh until God tells me otherwise, as I don’t believe it’s my time just yet. And even if the doctors say there’s only a 10% chance of survival, well praise God I plan to be part of that 10%. I refuse to look on the down side and choose to look for the positive even in this. As I’m sitting here writing, I’m crying, but not out of sadness but out of gratefulness. My heart is so full of gratitude towards God. I know that sounds strange, but I’m thankful for all He’s given me. I look back over my life and it’s filled with His goodness. He’s never let me down before and I know He won’t this time either. But nevertheless, I know who I am and I know that even death can not hold me, for what is death but a transition to where I truly belong with Him! David and I are humbled by all the people who have rallied to help us in practical ways as well as in prayer. I feel God’s hand in all of this and have a peace that I know is coming directly from Him. With that being said, this is going to be a long term journey and we’re going to need all the help we can get. We’re currently looking into some alternative therapies to combine with chemo and surgery which come at a high cost and are not covered by insurance. It’s $75,000 for a 3 month program. Plus, we are in need to eventually hire help for newborn and other child/household care at a cost that I’m not even sure right now. My mom, friends and church family have us covered at the moment, but we anticipate this to be a long term journey, and I can’t imagine us sustaining our current care situation for 6+ months without at least some hired help. I’m not one to ask for handouts, and I hate doing it even now, but we ourselves do not have the money, so in humility, I’m asking for any monetary support you feel led to give. And most importantly, beyond money, I’m asking for your prayers. I’m asking you to petition the throne room of God, on my behalf, and ask that He perform a miracle in my body. We are supernatural beings who serve a supernatural God, whom I know can heal me in the blink of an eye if He so chooses. I also believe that when the people of God come together in a unified voice, they have impact and can amplify action in the spiritual world that our individual voices never could. There is power in numbers. And finally, to every person reading this right now… I pray for YOU, that God would touch your heart in a personal way and let His goodness be seen in YOUR life. I pray that through my situation, your heart would be stirred to look towards Christ, and know Him as a close personal friend in the same way that I do. If you don’t know Christ as a friend or you’re unsure about your life after death, let me assure you - God is real and this life is not all there is. You are more than just the body you see in the mirror. So I challenge you to call out to God and let Him speak into your heart and reveal His goodness into your soul. With much love and appreciation, Jill and David  ",28782,125000,6 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/jacobspeights,Brain Tumor at 28," Hello all. My name is Jacob, im 29 years old. On August 26, 2020, i was diagnosed with a 4.2cm Vestibular  Schwannoma tumor on the left side of my brain. Due to the size and the location of the tumor- i had surgery to remove it in October 2020 at Duke University Hospital in Durham, NC..however they had to leave a small residual piece in hopes to avoid paralyzing the left side of my face or causing harm to my brain stem. The chances of the piece growing or causing further harm were very very slim. While it took months to recover from this- i came out a stronger person, and looked for ways to live life to the fullest as it put things into perspective for me that life should be lived like there is no tomorrow.. Fast Forward to September 2021, i returned to the Oncologist to have my first annual MRI, to check the healing progress and to check the residual tumor.. and the news i had was shocking. The odds were against me, and the tumor had grown slightly over the past year- BUT, there is a silver lining- due to it being smaller now, and the time passed with the tissue healed around it- i wouldnt need surgery this time, rather just 5 weeks of radiation therapy.  The radiation has taken some toll on my body physically, causing high levels of fatigue and some slight headaches which has caused my time away from work to be more than expected.. But even with my FMLA protection- Since i was only allowed 3 hours a day for treatment and only two days out the week that i could have a full day off- i failed to meet the requirements for Short Term Disability pay with my company.. which now has me missing relatively 20+ hours of work a week…and creating a  deficit in my finances for rent/housing, utilities, and a vehicle loan taken shortly before my annual followup, as well as the cost to meet my insurance deductible of $3000.  Any help provided is greatly appreciated. <3 ",3150,3000,22-Oct-21

Alex has spent 10 long months in the hospital fighting for his life. When his heart and liver began to fail he was placed on an ECMO machine and dialysis. We didn't know if he would ever be able to breathe on his own, let alone make it out of the hospital. Needless to say, it's been a very long journey with many ups and downs. We weren't sure he was gonna pull through. But, Alex is a fighter! He has finally made it home yet he still has a very long way to go. The virus attacked his lungs leaving him in need of a lung transplant. He is on oxygen 24 hours a day --  which is very costly. He needs lots of additional care which are trying to navigate and figure out how to pay for it all. According to the doctors, he will need at least 6 months of care so, if you are in a position to give, we are hoping you can make a much-needed donation.

On Feb. 23, 2021 she was driving home from work, and as she turned off the highway, she went completely blind in both eyes. She scheduled an eye doctor appointment for Feb. 25th. Upon arrival at that appointment, the  eye doctor looked in her eyes and told her staff to call 911.   Murph was told her optic nerves were swollen and there was hemorrhaging behind her eyes.  She was immediately sent to Inova Fairfax Hospital.  The doctors were waiting for her and immediately began running tests.  The CT scan and MRI revealed she has numerous lesions and tumors on her brain, spine, jaw, ribs, pelvis and hip, and was told she had Multiple Myeloma cancer.  She did radiation for 30 days in March and has been on chemo since April.  This is a blood cancer and she has to have a stem cell bone marrow transplant in order to live.  Not only are her medical expenses going to be through the roof, she has treatment appointments every day in Nov. and Dec. at John’s Hopkins. This hospital does not provide parking for their patients, and parking alone will be no less than $12 a day.  Nobody should have to go thru this, and it’s devastating to me that my friend has to. I just want to take some worry off of her, and ask for help to relieve her of some financial burden.  The out of pocket expenses are very expensive to include daily parking for daily treatment at John’s Hopkins Hospital, necessity of a 24 hour care giver, transplant center stay for 2 months, medical supplies, etc.   Murph is forever grateful for all the love, support and prayers from all of you.

For the past few month she has been going to Roswell for treatment and gos every Thursday to get fluid removed. The treatment she is getting isnt working how it should and she’s looking for a second opinion. We have done much research on skilled hospitals and professionals that specialize in this type of cancer. We came across Sloan Kettering which is located in nyc. With going to a hospital in nyc she’ll have to travel back in forth a lot and that can get expensive. Not to mention we don’t have the greatest insurance and a lot of things aren’t fully covered. I started this go fund me to help my mom with travel expensive and treatments that aren’t fully covered. If you know my mom personally you’d know that she helps and cares for everyone around her and this time she needs the help. Anything will help from donating money to sharing this around. thank you ❤️ ",8150,9999,3 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/v5agu-please-help-billy,Please help Billy," Hi, family and friends. It is with a heavy heart that I share with you Billy will be passing on any day now. I'm sitting here shaking and tearing in his hospital room as I don't even know how to begin writing a message like this. Part of me wants to write just to vent and share the struggle and hardship we have been going through. And yet part of me feels ashamed as we know there are many other people in the world who are also sick and dying. But I write this at Billy's request so here it goes... What we thought earlier this year to be simply back pain from playing golf turned into a nightmare, and the heavy blow that he has Stage 4 Lung Cancer has changed our lives. Since June he has bravely faced 4 surgeries, 9 treatments of Chemotherapy, 13 sessions of Radiation, with an average of 8 appointments per week. Billy is fighting for his life in the hospital and maintains a positive attitude throughout the rigorous medical treatment. However, it has come to the point where the doctors have expressed that nothing further can be done for him at this time. We are doing our best to keep him comfortable, but he has more moments of pain and less times being lucid. Although none of us really know when our time is over, anyone would agree that Billy's time has been cut too short. He will pass on just a few weeks shy of seeing his 44th birthday. During the few minutes when he is conscious, he smiles over to Madison who is sitting on the couch drawing a picture for daddy. We squeeze hands and share a quiet glance, reluctantly accepting he will be leaving me (his wife) and our beautiful, 7-year old, daughter (who of course takes after her mom), Madison. As she asks, ""Is Daddy dying today?"", the wave of emotions is overwhelming and all I can do is hug her and cry... This brave, intuitive kid beside me who has been silently watching the doctors and nurses help Daddy will hopefully grow stronger from this traumatic experience. As a respiratory therapist Billy saved lives and helped bring happiness to his patients in their final days. Billy dedicated his life to helping people, and in his time of need, he hopes to receive some of what he has so generously given. He's an inspiration to everyone and his hard work ethic with genuine passion to making a difference is reflected in his thriving team. Billy is truly an amazing person at work and at home. We are so blessed to have him in our lives and know his spirit will continue on in each of us. We are very grateful and sincerely touched by the friends and family who have shared their good wishes and prayers. During Billy's final moments, we humbly reach out for support from all of our loved ones. Billy has requested to make a gofundme to be sent to all of you to assist us with this ordeal and make sure we make it through these difficult times... Our family thanks you in advance for your thoughtfulness and genererosity. With love, Billy, Abegale, and Madison ",28353,10000,7 days

Dan was diagnosed with the most aggressive type of prostate cancer in 2017 at age 50. He had his prostate and prostate nerves removed in June 2017 and started treatments to block testosterone/hormones.   He and his family moved to Alaska in July 2017.

Please take a few seconds to read below- Amanda has been dealing with health issues over the past year after a visit to the hospital sparked her to seek our ongoing medical help with a GI issue that was causing her intermittent weight loss (at times substantial). Fast forward to about a month ago, Amanda felt extremely ill in her home and was rushed to the hospital to find out that she had a form of COVID that was interacting with her stomach and liver. A few weeks ago, she was discharged from the hospital once COVID negative but within days began to feel ill & eventually started coughing up blood & fell back extremely ill. She has been in the hospital for 34 days total now and we just received the news that she has limited time to find a donor for her liver as she has end-stage liver disease. The wait list is too long for the normal transplant and the doctors fear that her time could only be 2-3 months unless she can successfully undergo transplant surgery. I am working with her Husband Mike to raise money/awareness for this sudden and unfortunate diagnosis. Its said the transplant will exceed her insurance levels upwards of $250-500,000 in surgery cost. We are seeking ANYTHING to assist and will be finding other means to come up with the difference. Additionally, we will be looking at friends and family for donors but open to any ideas anyone has. Amanda is a devoted mother of 3 children (Paige, Chase, Cole) & today is her 35th birthday. This is far to young to be put in this situation but with everyone's help we can all do our part to help. For those of you that know her, her hospitality and a truly ""open door"" approach to her home to anyone highlighted the type of person she is. Always accommodating others in need-- I am hoping that some will return the a warm gesture in her time of need. Please be kind enough to spare a donation towards this difficult life event for her and her family. ",10980,15000,4 days

Their faith in the Lord has continued strong despite the difficulty of their journey. As most of you know, Jummai has undergone the amputation of her two legs below the knee and will later lose most of her two hands. What lies ahead is an expensive and painful journey of healing that will include costly prosthetics, additional surgery, and necessary modifications to their lifestyle including modifications to their home and a different vehicle. You have been faithful in your prayers. Will you now be generous in your financial assistance to help them bear this burden? The NAMB (North American Mission Board) and the MWBC (the Minnesota-Wisconsin Baptist Convention) will do all we can to support the Naches but we will need your help. Many of you will remember that the Naches were one of the 2019 missionary couples featured by the Annie Armstrong Easter Offering (see video here, WEEK OF PRAYER - AAEO 2019: Church Planting in Minneapolis ). This is a special couple through which the Lord continues to do seemingly impossible gospel ministry to the world. If you have any questions, please contact me or Na Herr in our office: www.mwbc.org. PHILIP NACHE: JUMMAI’S JOURNEY WITH COVID-19 VACCINE/COVID-19My name is Philip Nache and my wife is Jummai. We are church planters with the North American Mission Board, sent to serve under MWBC in the Twin cities, Minnesota among the African community and also reaching out and training churches to know how to develop relationship with their Muslim neighbors. We had been missionaries in the northern part of Nigeria, an area dominated by Muslims for 20 years before we came to America to further our theological studies. God used us to bring many souls to the kingdom in Nigeria and many of those are now Missionaries and Pastors. Our ministry continues with adding converts here in the United States. For more information about our ministry, click the links at the end of their story. This is the story about my wife Jummai. She is a medical assistant who worked in one of the clinics in Minneapolis MN, where she was instructed to take the covid-19 vaccine. After receiving her second Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine on February 1, 2021 she started to experience chest pain at work. Three days after the chest pains I took her to Urgent Care on February 6, 2021. After the checkup, EKG and other tests, the doctor said there was nothing wrong with her chest and every test showed she was okay. She took a covid-19 test and the next day was confirmed positive. Jummai and I were shocked when we received the result that she was covid-19 positive because she had not manifested any symptom before taking the shot. But we later accepted that perhaps, the virus and the vaccine together contributed to the adverse reaction on her body based on the report of the Infectious Disease physician that Jummai was asymptomatic. So Jummai followed the CDC guidelines but then a few days later she ended up at Fairview ER and then was transferred to U of M medical center. The next day, 2/14/21 the doctor called and told me that her heart was deteriorating, her oxygen levels and blood pressure were low and she needed to be put on a ventilator. I gave approval for them to proceed with the ventilator as needed.The Infectious Disease Dr considered the test results, Jummai's condition, the timeline of the administered vaccine and the onset of covid 19, realizing the vaccine might have caused the adverse reaction. But the Dr always concludes that this is just a theory which cannot be verified because they do not have testing equipment to clearly state that the vaccine has caused Jummai's devastation.  Whatever the cause may be, my wife is suffering unbearable excruciating pain and permanent catastrophic damage. The consequences of the adverse event are as follows: 1. Arterial blood clot; 2. Respiratory distress—ventilator; 3. Cardiomyopathy; 4. Anemia; 5. Damage to fingers of both hands and toes of both feet; 6 Ischemia; 7. MIS-Multiple Inflammatory Syndrome. As a result of the above complications, the Infectious Disease Dr decided to forward the case to CDC. According to the Dr, after going back and forth with the CDC, they decided to meet to deliberate with many experts around the country in which about 70-80 doctors met on a virtual call to discuss Jummai's case. About 8 weeks after the meeting the CDC sent us a letter of their conclusions which stated that Jummai was infected with MIS-A and covid-19, but they cannot conclude whether the covid-19 vaccine contributed for now. Since Jummai's blood specimen which was taken at the onset of this nightmare is saved in the lab, we pray for God's provision of a separate body of experts who could study Jummai's very unique case to draw other conclusions. As the CDC related, Jummai's case is very unique. Since my request to be in that meeting was not granted, I submitted the following questions for the CDC experts’ response:1. When her symptoms started, I was with her, eating and sleeping together, but I tested negative and did not have any symptoms. Why am I not positive? 2. If she got the vaccine before the virus or got them at the same time, did the clashing of the covid-19 and the vaccine cause such adverse reactions? Why didn’t the CDC or Pfizer let us know? Or why wouldn’t they ask everyone to be tested for covid-19 first, before taking the vaccine?3. If the vaccine is meant to defeat the virus, either by destroying it or weakening its effect, why the adverse severe damage? If the vaccine did not work to defeat the virus, what role was the vaccine playing in Jummai's body?On one occasion, the doctor called and told me that Jummai could die at any moment, but God preserved my wife's life in a miraculous way in response to all the prayers of the church. He has continued to do amazing things in her life, to which we testify. Three weeks ago, the cardiologist told us that Jummai's heart is 100% healed. By God's grace, this goes against the initial report which was that her heart would never be the same. To God be the glory! I have also appreciated God's grace of healing her from the life-threatening impact of the vaccine/Covid-19 destruction, but it has required high risk surgeries for amputation of both legs (below the knees). When those are healed, she is yet to undergo amputations at both hands. My experience on this journey has been so difficult but I can't imagine the excruciating pain mentally, physically and emotionally that my wife is going through. I can only equate her experience and challenge with Job's experience and trial in the sense that the challenges have come in degrees, one after another. She would have one challenge and we would thank God as overcomers and then the devil would present the next challenge and we would overcome yet again. Time and again, challenge after challenge. I wasn't asking why the righteous suffer and I also encouraged Jummai to take the same approach, not because we have a strong faith but because of the example of the heroes of faith like Job. The Bible says, in 1 Thessalonians 5:18 ""...give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus"" We are grateful to God for His grace upon Jummai, the children and myself as we go through this unprecedented experience and the painful challenges! GOD KNOWS!On behalf of my family, we are eternally grateful for your generous support and prayers!

Updates will be posted as new information becomes available.  UPDATE FROM JEFFREY'S WIFE 6/23: He's sedated and on a ventilator. The doctors are trying to figure out what's causing the kidneys and lungs to not be functioning properly. They suspect an autoimmune disease, but haven't gotten confirmation yet. He's finally stable enough to have the biopsies done on his kidneys and lungs today. Both procedures were successful and Jeffrey did well during both. Those results will come in tomorrow and will tell the Dr's a lot. He has had a blood transfusion and will have more if needed. He is having his 2nd round of hemodialysis and plasmapheresis right now to filter his blood of the toxins and antibodies that are making him sick and removing his plasma and replacing it with clean donor plasma. He will have a 3rd round tonight and continued daily as needed. He's on heavy antibiotics and steroids. There was no evidence of sepsis so that's great news. His kidneys are producing some urine so that's good news and his potassium levels are now normal. They also found less blood in his lungs today compared to yesterday so that's positive as well. His EKG and heart tests were all normal, praise God.That's all the info I have at this time. I'll update as I know more.Thankfully, I'm allowed to visit him at this hospital. The kids, Connie and I are staying in a hotel a couple blocks away. I have been here at the hospital all day and will be here every day until he walks outta here. I'm not leaving his side.

While we can't control the outcomes of this diagnosis, it's my goal to do everything we can for this family and help give their children the joy they deserve. The Crowe family has four beautiful children; Bella, Jake, Saige and Satcher,  Their parents Paige and Jake noticed early on that something wasn't as it should be with Satcher. That first doctors visit was the beginning of a long, exhausting, and terrifying series of tests, questions, hospital visits, and late nights. After nearly two years of unanswered questions, we found out that Satcher has been diagnosed with a progressive mitochondrial disorder. Prognosis is not good. Life expectancy is gut wrenching with most children with infant onset returning to their heavenly home between their second and third birthday. Satcher is 27 months old. They are also testing Saige to see if she has gone undiagnosed. We pray she is healthy. As you can imagine, this is a parent's absolute worst nightmare. Specifics on Satcher: 98% of his blood mitochondria has a genetic change. While this change causes a spectrum of disease ranging from NARP to Leigh’s syndrome. It is most likely he has the latter and more severe. This disease comes with rapid and sudden decline. usually onset by a simple viral infection requiring their bodies to spend too much energy fighting illness and not enough for basic life functions ultimately resulting in respiratory failure. Moving forward we have to check into the hospital at the first signs of illness (runny nose, cough, slight fever) and have to be extremely cautious around anyone with illness. Satcher's family and friends are clinging to the fact he is still progressing and has tolerated illness well in the past. They will travel to Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia to see the specialist there as soon as they can see them. In the meantime Paige and Saige have to be tested. Our biggest prayer is that she doesn’t have it, too. Please help us raise money for this precious family so that they can give Satcher the care and experiences he needs and deserves. While we can't control the outcome, we can control how we react to it. I'm humbly asking for your help to play a role in helping this family heal. ",13130,10000,27-Jul-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/94qbw-fight-for-josh,Fight For Josh,"Kim and  Britt is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Keith Dowd. With deep gratitude in our hearts, we reach out to anyone who wants to help our dearest friend. On July 11, 2021, Josh was brutally assaulted and left for dead on railroad tracks. Thankfully, he was found hours later and rushed to Grady Hospital in Atlanta where he received life-saving brain surgery.Since then, Josh has been treated at two additional facilities. He’s now undergoing intense physical, speech, occupational and recreational therapy at Shepherd Center. They’re also continuing to address numerous other underlying ailments which stemmed from his attack.In the early days, doctors said it’d be unlikely Josh would awaken from his coma. Furthermore, if he did emerge from it, it’d be highly unlikely he’d live a functional life outside of an assisted care facility. Nothing can prepare you for such tragic news.Thankfully, the latest prognosis is that Josh is likely to achieve a “very good” recovery. While we don’t know where that will lead him just yet, we have faith that he is on the right path. His family and friends have all been by his side as he mounts what his doctors now describe as a “miraculous” recovery. His strength and your prayers have made this possible.Josh is the most kind, caring, spirited, Ariana Grande-loving person on this planet. He has changed the lives of many and is the type who leaves a mark everywhere he goes. His story has inspired people around the world and we’re eternally grateful for the love and support he’s received.We continue to ask anyone who knows him, and even those who haven’t met him yet, to help his cause. Donations help pay current and future medical bills along with the enormous costs to transition back to a self-reliant world. In addition to all of that, he of course still has everyday expenses, bills and loan payments to tend to. Our hope is that as Josh goes through the next two years of therapy, he’ll be able to worry less about funds and more about his recovery and living life.As we’ve said many times, thanks to everyone who’ve shared prayers, positive messages and financial support. Josh has come so far and still has a long road ahead of him. Doctors and therapists tell us routinely: “This is a marathon, not a sprint.” This global community continues to provide Josh the fuel he needs to finish this race. We thank and we love you all.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/hickey-conjoined-twins,Hickey Conjoined Twins,"Dana  Young is organizing this fundraiser. On June 11, 2021 Charla & Logan went for their routine 20+ week anatomy scan of their baby girl. Only to receive the unbelievable news that there was not only one baby but two! Further into the ultrasound it was discovered that the twins are conjoined. This had went undiscovered the entire pregnancy leaving them with little to no options moving forward. The best thing the hospital could offer was the option to terminate within 4 days. Not giving them enough time to ethically process what they had just found out or not giving them time to find surgeons that could help their twin girls. Now in the 5th month of pregnancy they are scrambling to do whatever they can to help their baby girls survive and have a chance at life. Its a miracle that the twins have survived long as they have and healthy all things considered. The family does have 3 older children ages 21 months up to 8 years old. So not only will this affect mom and dad but also brothers and sister as well. The family is on a roller coaster of emotions thinking of the upcoming visits to specialists and the continued development of the girls. Ultimately the girls are expected to be delivered in late September to early October and from that point on they will inevitably be in the hospital for months to follow. They will go through potential surgeries and many other medical necessities to fight for their lives. Charla and Logan are from Louisville, KY and are having to navigate through logistics in order to prepare to welcome their twin girls many of which will come with heavy financial expense. They will have to travel out of town hundreds of miles away from home and will have to make living arrangements temporarily while the girls are in the hospital. Our hope is to help raise funds to support the family now through the babies recoveries. Beyond the medical bills they will have living expenses, travel expenses and child care for their 3 older children and much more. The family is leaning on God throughout this journey and trusting that things will work out how they are supposed to. Thank you for considering a donation to support them during this time.UPDATE: after going to multiple hospitals and meetings with several professionals we have received the hopeful news that the team of doctors in Florida are willing to try separation if all goes well with the evaluation once they are born. We know God is capable of all things and we are praying for a miracle for these girls.  In order to make this a possibility we are needing support and donations from our friends, family and community to be able to travel and stay in Florida. We do not know how long we willbe there but it is expected to be several months. Charla will need to deliver via C Section by the end of September and then remain in Florida until the planned surgery to separate the twins, plus recovery time before being released tocome back home to Kentucky.  The family will have to rent a place to stay during the time spent in Florida for everything they will have to go through. Most places are not furnished so they will have many expenses come up. The family has 3 other children that will have to relocate as well. Please pray for this family during this difficult time as they face many obstacles and heartache.  UPDATE: We wanted to share a update with everyone that the girls have been born! September 1st they were delivered and are stable and doing well thanks to God and a great team of doctors. Charla has done well with the surgery and is on the road to recovery. We are still asking for your prayers and support while the familyis off work and for all that is to come in the weeks ahead. All of you are very much appreciated and the family is so grateful for all of the helpand prayers received! The family still has a long and uncertain road ahead so please keep crane prayers coming and the family in your thoughts.  Thank you all and God bless!  ",19153,80000,28-Jun-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/e2am4z-support-waters-through-brain-surgery-recovery,Support Waters through Brain Surgery & Recovery,"Abigail Ohler Bower is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Lionel Semedo. While out on a run on June 10th, 2021, Waters Lionel Semedo lost control of his body and suddenly fell - dangerously and hard. After breathing through his adrenaline and the visceral shock and fear that came from realizing that he was not in control of his balance and movement, Waters managed to get home and drive himself into the hospital. Water’s vitals were measured and the nurses and doctors suddenly sprang into action. His blood pressure was 236/165 (stage 3 hypertension) putting him at severe risk for stroke. He was no longer allowed to leave the hospital, and a barrage of tests followed, in seeking answers to what was causing his vitals to be so seriously out of whack. After an MRI scan, the news came back. A ping pong ball-sized tumor was found growing from the auditory nerve, pressing on the brain stem and the optical nerve -- causing vision, and balance problems. Waters was immediately rushed from the Berkshires Hospital to Mass General Hospital for an emergency surgery to install a Shunt in his head, which acts as a pressure release valve for cerebrospinal fluid. The doctors explained that the shunt installation enables them to be able to perform the second surgery that must take place at the beginning of August, once the recovery time from placing the shunt is complete. The second surgery will be the big one: Removing the tumor. The tumor is called an Acoustic Neuroma, which doctors say needs to be removed ASAP. Brain surgery naturally comes with risk, but the location and size of the tumor makes this procedure particularly delicate and dangerous. The neurosurgeon team thinks they can pull it off and Water’s mom says it is NOT his time to go!! However Waters is facing the reality that he needs to hope for the best, and prepare for the worst. If surgery goes well and Waters comes out on the side we want him on - the recovery side - the rehabilitation period necessary will be extensive and astronomically expensive. Currently, Waters is working with MassHealth Advocacy group to get what coverage he can, but so far he has little concept as to how much of the surgery will be covered by Mass Health. This is a terrifying time. Everything that Waters was doing in his daily life leading up to this has come to an abrupt stop, with all hands on deck necessary to focus on the task at hand -- getting through the surgeries, recovery, and healing. Waters is facing immense hospital bills for the surgeries themselves, and extensive physical therapy and around the clock care following his surgery, for a period of likely at least a year. Waters will need the helping hands of friends and family to get him to and from doctors appointments and to be driven around in general for various appointments and day to day needs. He will not be able to work during this time, and therefore will have no income or any of the means of financial support necessary for our average daily existence. He will need support to keep food in his home and bills paid. Waters is a staple figure of healing, love, compassion, and a force to be reckoned with within the Boston, greater Boston, Worcester, and Berkshires Massachusetts communities. Waters is a healer. He has been a practicing massage therapist for 11 years. He is a community builder. For years, Waters has engaged with and supported the arts and music scenes of the greater Boston community, and is considered an integral action-oriented player to keeping these communities thriving. Waters has a big heart and a hug to match - both of which absolutely envelope you to your core when in his presence, or his arms. Waters has a vision. For the last 5 years, Waters has been working diligently to launch his dream - his founding vision of CHI. CHI - or The Center for Harmonious Integration - has a goal of cultivating a multi faceted approach that considers all angles in providing economic wellness to Massachusetts by addressing housing and food insecurity dilemmas, and mental and physical health wellness, to name a few. CHI addresses the need for healing, social wellness and collective progress head on, focusing on low income community needs and structural inequalities based on race and class divide. Waters strives to build more affordable housing in New England and to acknowledge the struggle that people of color in these communities have endured over the years, and to use CHI to uplift these communities. The work and dedication that Waters has put toward his vision is nothing short of ambitious, impressive, and admirable. His determination has been ceaseless, and his efforts have paid off. Waters has multiple endorsements and investor backings toward his vision of CHI - and it is of the utmost importance to our communities at large that Waters is able to recover fully from this surgery and continue building this mission. Waters has stated that ""CHI is still the mission whether I'm here or not."" He is used to being the healer, the strong one, the one that anyone can lean on or call in a time of need. To say that putting this information out about his current health predicament has been difficult for him is an understatement. Waters is not one to ever ask for help. He was reared by his single loving mother and learned young how to always look out for himself - with a deeply ingrained mind set of the necessity to not rely on others in order to get by, but simultaneously, to always extend a helping hand to others. Well, now he needs our help - and he’s going to get it. Our mission now is that we will do everything in our power to get him back on his feet and working toward his dream -- fostering and enriching the communities in which we reside, so that we may ALL thrive. We ask that you please consider donating anything at all that you can, and help us to spread the word as much as possible. Waters recovery depends on any helping hands and financial backing that we can muster. Updates will continue as we learn more about his condition and the road that lies ahead. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, for supporting this cause. Waters sends all of his love out to each and every one of you, as do we all!                                                   Waters with team CHI -- Waters, Tom Karis, Dr. Uma, and Shavaji.                                                                                                 Big smiles through it all!!!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/4mx6d6-deep-brain-stimulation-surgery,Deep Brain stimulation surgery,"Team fundraiserTomas Vitale and Patricia Cagnoli are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Patricia Cagnoli.       My name is Tomas, my family calls me Tommy, and I have Tourette’s and OCD. I was in 5th grade when I started to have the urge to make noises and move, say random words, and move. I didn’t know why it was happening, I just knew I could not stop it. Soon after, I was                  diagnosed with Tourette’s, a disorder characterized by chemical imbalances in the brain that causes involuntary vocal and motor tics.I remember being relieved to find a diagnosis, but I did not realize at the time how these two diseases would so profoundly alter every          aspect of my life. My tics have been so severe, that I have pulled out most of my teeth. I have lost friendships due to the uncontrollable          nature of my tics which have been annoying to others. I couldn’t attend a regular high school and had to live in schools away from my              family. I’ve been asked my colleges and jobs to leave due to the intrusive nature of coprolalia, the excessive and uncontrollable use of foul or            obscene language. I have been bullied, mocked, and even expulsed from a church. Rather than having adventures with friends and family,  my childhood and adolescence have been spent with a never-ending succession of doctors. Visit after visit we found that most medications did not work, or if they did the relief was short-lived, providing only a temporary reprieve from my increasingly persistent tics.  Even ECT    did not  improve my symptoms.    I have researched a brain surgery called DBS where electrodes are inserted into the areas of the brain thought to cause the problems of    Tourette’s and OCD. I completed several days of assessments by experts at the Mayo Clinic, they all agree I was a good candidate for this    procedure which is only offered in the most severe cases.  I am older now, and tired of this non-life, tired of being told to leave, tired of never having a place to belong.  The possibility of this                     treatment has given me hope that instead of merely existing, I could have a life. I could try for college and a job again and maybe find somebody who will see ME, not my tics or quirks, and love me for who I am. Sadly despite having health insurance – my surgery will not be covered. I have a strong support system in my family, who are working day and night to come up with funds, but out-of-pocket neurosurgery fees are just too much. I am here to tell you my story and ask for help if you can. It does not matter how much or how little you can contribute, even 1 dollar gets  me closer to a chance at a reasonable life, to accomplish my dreams of becoming a special education teacher, taking part in a theater play, having friends, and a job, help my family, and hopefully, one day make my own family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-meredith-wyatt,"Fundraiser for Meredith, Wyatt & the Vandefords","Lisa Degrood Luckman is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Meredith Vandeford. Early this year, Meredith's son, Wyatt (now 10 years old) had his cancer relapse out of remission, and it's been a very frightening time for all of the Vandeford family. Thankfully Wyatt's little brother, Emerson (7 years old) was a good match for a Bone Marrow Transplant that took place 2nd quarter; however, there have been so many complications and continuous new issues post transplant that has kept him in the hospital with uncertainty. Wyatt has been in and out of PICU this past 2 months, struggling to breath on his own. He has endured dialysis treatments, infections, virus's, and complications that are still baffling the medical teams. Meredith has been living at the hospital, at Wyatt's side from the start, doing everything she can to ease his mind and pain, maintaining that strong Mom face for him, but being absolutely torn apart inside as you can only imagine. Due to his compromised immune system, they have not seen much of daylight, and they have had limited visitation with Nick (Dad), Emerson, and other family members these past several months. The boys have been fending for themselves at home, which has been challenging. Not only are there are a variety of expenses piling up medically of course, but also from every other direction, and day to day help is desperately needed. I know there are a lot of you that want to help Meredith, Wyatt and their family through this difficult time. We're hoping this provides the opportunity to share your concerns, care, wishes and help with them as they continue to fight this battle and deal with all that comes with this devastating circumstance. Your generosity is great appreciated. We are determined to provide some financial relief, so that they can focus on their first and most important concern to do everything they can for Wyatt's full recovery. Thank you for your help.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/michael-needs-our-help-fighting-cancer,Michael Needs Our Help Fighting Cancer,"Michael Fernstrom is organizing this fundraiser. Michael needs our help. He has been diagnosed with stage IV metastatic colon cancer. Without treatment, doctors have given him 6 months to live.  On July 7th, after a week of stomach issues, Michael decided to visit a walk in clinic. Leaving with no answers or relief he decided he should go to the emergency room, where they performed routine tests and a CT of his abdomen. This revealed some kind of mass in his colon and also smaller masses on his liver. The next morning, a colonoscopy uncovered a large tumor that was blocking his entire intestine. Michael was rushed into emergency surgery. He awoke with a colostomy and terrifying news… the doctors were confident it was cancer and that it had already metastasized to his liver. He was admitted to the hospital to recover from this abdominal surgery.  For 3 days, we all sat in agonizing fear waiting for the pathology results from the liver biopsy. Our worst fears were confirmed. At 35 years old, Michael was diagnosed with stage IV metastatic colon cancer. After a week at Advent hospital, multiple bouts of sickness, complications and set backs, it was decided to transfer Michael to Tampa General Hospital, where he could be seen by a team of specialized doctors with more resources.  Once at TGH, the doctors were alarmed at the condition of his ostomy. The stoma was retracting, there were signs of a massive infection and they determined he would need to undergo another colostomy surgery to move the stoma site. They completed this very difficult surgery on July 20th and we were back where we started, NG tube, no food or water and recovering in even more immense pain. His next few blood tests indicated a spiked white blood cell count, which meant another infection. Scans revealed a build up of fluid near his spleen. They performed an aspiration of the fluid, to learn what antibiotics were needed and everything seemed to be okay. The next morning he started to experience unbearable pain. His vitals were going haywire. His heart rate spiked to 155 and his blood pressure dropped to low double digits -we nearly lost Michael this day. Doctors and nurses rushed into the room and began administering fluids and performing tests. After multiple blood transfusions, the rapid response team was able to stabilize him and he spent the next 5 days in ICU. We found he had gone into hemoragic shock, due to an internal bleed from the spleen. While in the ICU, they kept transfusing blood and began a sepsis protocol. They decided to do an emergency IR surgery to stop the bleed in the spleen. This procedure effectively gave him a splenectomy without actually removing his spleen. He will have to get vaccines to mimic the spleen’s function now. Since these complications, Michael’s vitals have never returned to what they once were. His heart is constantly racing, particularly when he moves to a standing position. He often experiences nausea, and his blood pressure and heart rate are in constant flux.  In spite of his unstable condition and inability to stand for more than a minute or two, they discharged him on August 11th after 35 days in the hospital. Now, he will begin his fight against the cancer. August 18, he made his first visit to Moffitt Cancer Center.  Through this bumpy road Michael has remained composed and calm and ready to fight for his life. If you are lucky enough to know Fernstrom, then you can understand. Michael is too many things to list.. to start he is a passionate musician. He loves his job managing a musical instruments store, connecting aspiring and accomplished musicians with the perfect instrument. He also enjoys expressing these musical gifts as the lead singer of a local rock n roll band, Old Bones. He is a wild adventurer and loves the outdoors, camping his way across the nation several times. He is a super hard worker in everything he does, a handyman who enjoys fixing things himself, a dog lover, a drone flyer and a super talented video producer. Michael is a loving and thoughtful son, a brother, and a kind human who helps strangers when he sees they’re in need. Michael is a once in a lifetime friend who will do anything he can for the people he loves. With his courage, strength, and downright stubborn determination he will be a future cancer survivor. Michael has not been able to work since he began this journey on July 7th. Until his heart condition is solved, we are not sure when he will be able to return to his job. As a family we are pulling together to help him meet his existing financial obligations like mortgage, car payment and insurance, electric, and other personal debts. There are now many added expenses like paying continued health insurance, doctor visit co-pays (several each week), uncovered medications, special health supplies and health aids. There are many costs that come along with extended health care, not to mention the fact that he cannot mow his yard or be the DIY handyman at this time. Our fundraising goal is to be able to raise enough money to cover Michael’s current and future medical expenses so that he does not have to be concerned with how to make that happen while undergoing treatment. Any financial contribution you can make would be so greatly appreciated, but we also accept positive thoughts and prayers, which will be so uplifting during these trying times.  Thank you,  Michael’s Family  ",53276,60000,22-Aug-21

On October 3, 2021, Adam Weinstein suffered a massive stroke, paralyzing half of his body and requiring 4 brain surgeries to save his life. He spent weeks in ICU and has months of rehab and recovery on the road ahead. When he is strong enough, he will need open-heart surgery to replace a heart valve which has been poisoning his blood. Adam is young (34) and has a wife, Erica, and three small children: Twin girls Erin and Amelia (age 4) and a little boy named Carter (age 3). Adam was the main financial provider for their family. Why did this happen? Adam was born with a heart defect and underwent several heart surgeries in his youth to fix his heart valve defects. One of his valves was replaced with a mechanical valve at the age of 24 (2010). This mechanical valve has slowly collected bacteria and has been slowly poisoning his blood over the past 3 years (since 2019). It was unknown until Fall 2021 that the cause of his 18 hospital stays in the past 2 years, multiple surgeries to remove blood clots in his lungs, fevers, pains, chills, severe fatigue, weight-loss, and more… were due to the heart valve poisoning his blood. Unfortunately, this bacterial poisoning was not discovered until after he developed a clot in his groin on September 23, 2021. Once that clot was removed, he went on an intense course of antibiotics to clear the infection in his blood. The plan was, once the infection cleared, he would get the valve replaced within 6 weeks so that it would stop producing clots. Adam did not make it even two weeks later - he ended up having a massive stroke on October 3, 2021. His stroke paralyzed the left side of his body and required 4 brain surgeries to save his life. He has spent weeks in ICU and once he recovers enough, he will be transported to a rehab facility. Only when he is strong enough, he will finally have the open-heart surgery he needs to replace his faulty heart valve. We are not sure what will be recoverable from his stroke yet, it seems his left arm is lost (he is a lefty), but time will tell if he will be able to gain any motion in his left leg or eye. At this time (10/23/21) he has no function on his left side at all. He is beginning to speak but he is at times sharp, and at times he does not make sense. This is all so heavy for Erica and the children. How can you help? Erica and the children need to prepare their home for handicap accessibility. They will need a wheelchair accessible shower, a ramp into their home, and other changes. They will need a handicap van to transport their family. They could use help with Adam’s medical expenses, his long stay at rehab, and his upcoming open-heart surgery which will take place many states away from their home. As Adam was the main provider for their family, they would greatly appreciate any financial gift of any size. They also need prayers that he will not suffer another stroke as they await his surgery, prayers that he will recover from the stroke, and prayers for Erica and the children as they cope with a total life-change.To take them a meal, please click on the sign-up below:https://www.TakeThemAMeal.com/QLDI9758To follow them on FaceBook for the latest updates:https://www.facebook.com/Help-for-the-Weinstein-Family-108058255003748Again, thank you so much for reading this story and supporting this family.

After taking a targeted chemotherapy medication to shrink the tumor, he was able to have surgery at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX in September, 2020 to remove the tumor. The tumor was removed, but unfortunately 2 months later, returned in a more aggressive form. At this point in time, it is Kevin’s wish to return to Houston, where his mother, Jean, daughter Kiersten, and three grandchildren live. He and his wife, Hyon Suk Shin, are leaving Oahu for Houston on 10/23/21 and the current plan is to get Kevin immediately evaluated at MD Anderson for any further medical treatments available. His sons Chris (23) and Andrew (22) are both on Oahu. Andrew is now active duty Army stationed at Schofield Barracks. Kevin also has 3 step-children, Hannah, Jay and Jeffrey who have been a big support to him in recent weeks. Kevins family extends into the Military.

Afford Stroke Rehabilitation,"Ryan Wilhelm is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Scott Shields.My name is Scott Shields, and for the past 25 years I have taught high school English--with the past ten years being at Williams Field High School in Gilbert, Arizona.  I am also a busy drummer and an avid hiker.  On September 25, I was taken to the emergency room with a high fever, disorientation, and what would later be diagnosed as Viral Meningitis brought on by the West Nile Virus.  I spent the night in the ER due to a lack of hospital beds in the entire Phoenix area but was transported to Mercy Gilbert Hospital when a room finally opened up.  Days of treatments followed, along with many other tests to determine the damage that had been done by the virus.  The medical tests showed that the virus had caused two mini-strokes as well as some balance and fine-motor issues.  This required immediate and now ongoing rehabilitation.While I have been improving every day, it is going to require much work and continued rehabilitation for me to return to my former abilities.  And of course, there are the ongoing medical bills.         I estimate that I will need $10,384  to cover my medical expenses (ER and hospital costs, doctors, ambulance, tests, rehab, medications, equipment, etc.).  These bills will likely come due over the next several months.  With these realities in my immediate future, I can use any financial assistance you can possibly offer.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/lets-show-bobby-jamie-our-love-support,Let’s show Bobby & Jamie our love & support!," While I have donated to, shared and read so many stories on GoFundMe I never thought our family would be in the position to be creating an account. For those of you who know Bobby (Robert, Bob, Bob Lee, Booby, Bobby Wasabi) you know nothing but ridiculously long reenactment stories, a generous kind-hearted person, and a man of faith. Bobby and his partner, Jamie, have spent the last three years living the camper life to pay off all of their debt so they could purchase their dream home. On September 26th, 2021 they received the keys to their home and began moving. While the three years seemed to never end for them it was all worth it to have their dreams coming true. On September 27th, 2021 while finishing up unpacking Bobby experienced an episode. These episodes had been going on for a while now, but seemed to be getting worse and more frequent. Jamie took Bobby to the emergency room where he was then life-lined from Martinsville to Indianapolis. Bobby has been diagnosed, after several years of visiting specialists to no avail, with hemochromatosis. Hemochromatosis is a genetic disease that there is no cure for. It causes iron build up within the body, and the iron pools inside the organs causing damage. During his stay at the hospital there were many ups and downs, but he was eventually released on October 14, 2021. Bobby was sent home with a vest that would shock his heart in the event he went into tachycardia or any other abnormal rhythm to stabilize him until paramedics could arrive. As time went on Bobby did not feel as if he was getting better; rather he felt he was getting worse. On October 25, 2021 Bobby was having difficulty breathing and went back to the Mooresville Emergency Room. From there Bobby was, again, life-lined to Indianapolis. Upon his arrival to the Cardiac ICU, the doctors informed Bobby that his heart is enlarged, he has fluid build up around his heart and lungs and his body is now holding on to too much ammonia. This is all quickly impacting his already damaged heart. As of today, Bobby has a heart functioning at 19%, cirrhosis of the liver, and other unknown effects due to this disease. Jamie is currently working on appealing a denial of medication that would assist in eliminating the iron from his body as it is $38,000.00 out of pocket per month. We pray that this appeal is approved as the doctors are not able to take much blood at a time for fear his heart will stop. First and foremost, we ask that you pray for Bobby, the doctors and nurses caring for him and our family during these uncertain times. As you can imagine, their medical bills are quickly adding up. With just having purchased a new home, the cost of gas back and forth to the hospital and the cost of everyday living we want to ensure Bobby and Jamie are able to focus on Bobby’s health rather than the stress of everyday life. We are profoundly grateful for any donation you are able to give, all of the prayers and comforting words and sharing Bobby’s story. ",4760,10000,2 days

On Sunday, October 24TH Isla Jean, just shy of one and a half years old,  was diagnosed with a cerebellar brain tumor.  A parent’s nightmare, now a reality.  Isla’s mom Lindsey Dober Wood, an RN and Critical Care Transport paramedic , found herself on the receiving end of a critical medical  transport as they rushed Isla to Duke University Hospital in Durham, NC for emergency evaluation.  Isla’s dad Jon raced to Durham to face the daunting unknown after first arranging for the care of  Isla’s older sister Fisher.  Jon and Lindsey met with the amazing team at Duke and early Monday morning Isla had a drain placed to remove extra fluid  from around her brain before undergoing emergency surgery to remove the tumor.  At 10 pm on Monday night, family received the news that Isla had made it through a 6 hour surgery! The first battle had been won and Isla was showing great strength.  After meeting again with the medical team, Jon and Lindsey learned that they and their baby girl would have a journey ahead of them.  Isla will remain at Duke for a minimum of 2 weeks, where she will continue to recover with the love and prayers of family and friends.  Her near future will include chemotherapy to blast the remnants of the tumor and spinal lesions, physical therapy, repeat scans and any other interventions required to heal this beautiful baby girl.     While Jon and Lindsey focus all of their strength and energy on ensuring Isla receives the best care possible, friends and family, in addition to love, prayers and support can consider donating to this GoFundMe page to help reduce the burden of mounting medical expenses.  Lindsey, who has nursed others to health for many years, will now be nursing her daughter to health. Jon, Construction Project Manager for Trusst Builder Group, will now be building a new foundation for Isla.  The family and friends of Jon, Lindsey, Isla and Fisher hope that this fundraiser can relieve just a small part of their new reality.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/josen-needs-your-help,Josen Needs Your Help," Hi family and friends. As some of you know my little red bunny recently was in the hospital for a span of 14days and had to have 2 surgeries. Back in July my little guy just stop urinating, it happened as quickly as you turn a light switch on and off. We took him in thinking he was suffering from a UTI and ended up being in the hospital for far too long. At first they thought it was constipation and he was treated for it in the same manner adults do when a colonoscopy is needed, that yielded no results as he was still suffering from urinary retention. After more testing and a visit from neurology they found that he had Tethered Spinal Cord Syndrome which required surgery to the spine. This surgery was to untangle the spinal cord that had become tangled (tethered) at the very end of his spine and also to cut some of the spine bone off as his sine was far too long for him, this was surgery #1. The hope was and still is that he would then regain the ability to urinate by himself but that didn't happen and hasn't yet happened. In order to help him urinate Josen had to have a 2nd surgery to insert a suprapubic tube just under his belly button to help drain his bladder. Unfortunately these tubes need replacements every so many months that require yet more surgery. His is going in this Friday Oct 29th for a 3rd surgery. We aren't sure when he will urinate all by himself but we are hopeful that the day will come soon so that his constant discomfort and pain when going to use the bathroom ends soon for him. There is nothing harder as a parent than not being able to help your child when they are in agony, its the most helpless feeling in the world. As I am sure you all can imagine the medical bills are just pilling up, up and away, anything helps at this point. We thank you so much for your help and please keep Josen in your thoughts and prayers. ",5252,25000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/9a44y-support-mason-and-family-in-cancer-fight,Support Mason Grimmett & Family in Cancer Fight," Hello Dear Friends, Family & Mason Supporters, After much convincing, our dear friends, Scott and Jadey Grimmett have agreed to let us fundraise on their behalf.  Many of you have already graciously inquired about how you can help them as they face the fight of their lives. Mason, their 15 year old son, was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, in July of this year.  Through the quick actions of smart and caring doctors, the family was able to secure a full diagnosis in one weeks’ time.  It was discovered that Mason has a tumor below his knee, in his hip, and several spots in his lungs.  Mason went from a typical 14 year old boy playing baseball, dirt biking, and having fun with friends to enduring aggressive chemotherapy treatments. The treatments require inpatient care, 3.5 hours from their home in Idaho Falls, at Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City. Scott and Jadey are caring tirelessly for Mason as he undergoes extremely high dose chemotherapy cycles, all while traveling back and forth to another city and managing the needs of their 5 other children. We have started this fund, on their behalf, to help with travel, as well as any uninsured medical expenses.  The funds will be directly deposited into an account opened specifically for Mason.  Scott and Jadey will be donating any unused funds to Primary Children’s Hospital and the Ronald McDonald House.  They are extremely grateful for all of the support they have received from these organizations, as well as from their friends and family.  They are eternally grateful for each of you.  Anything you can do to support Scott, Jadey, Mason, and the Grimmett family in their fight against cancer, would be greatly appreciated. Mason, we love you. Stay strong buddy. We are here for you. ❤ #masonstrong1 Thank you! Amy, Kerry, and Amanda You can read their story (in Jadey’s words) below.  We also invite you to follow Mason’s fight on his Caring Bridge page:  https://www.caringbridge.org/public/masonstrong1  Journal entry by Jadey Grimmett — October 21, 2021 After an American Legion baseball tournament in Logan, Utah in late June, Mason complained of a sore left leg below his knee. With nothing immediately alarming, we enjoyed the 4th of July as normal with whitewater rafting, dirt bike rides and BBQs. Then about two weeks later, Mason showed me a small, raised bump right below his left knee. Of course, he had been playing summer baseball and his knees were skinned and scabbed from sliding and again this didn’t seem too alarming or out of the ordinary for an active 14-year-old boy. Our oldest son Gavin was working at Mountain View Redicare for the summer. On Tuesday, July 20 Gavin called and said they weren’t too busy and so Mason could get right in for an X-ray. After a doctor’s exam and an X-ray, the doctor returned to inform us that his initial impression of Osgood-Schlatter’s was not correct, and something was “odd” about his X-ray. We were given a large spectrum of ailments that this could be, but he referred us to see an orthopedic surgeon for further diagnosis. We then met with Orthopedic Surgeon, Dr. Mennear, he also confirmed that this X-ray was not the look of “normal bone” growth. He immediately scheduled Mason for an MRI later that day. We were impressed and thankful that Dr. Mennear was able to squeeze us into his schedule on Thursday, July 22 and that, again, the hospital was able to squeeze us in for an MRI that night at 9 p.m. With it being the weekend, we didn’t expect any results until Monday. However the next day, Friday afternoon, I was called and was told that there were distinct indications that this spot was a tumor, and we would need further care most likely from Primary Children’s hospital where cancer specialists would be able to better diagnose. Scott flew home Friday night, as he was performing his two weeks active duty in California with the Coast Guard. On Monday, July 25, we received a phone call asking if we could be to Salt Lake City by Tuesday afternoon. On Tuesday, July 26, after meeting with an orthopedic and oncologist specialist, we received news that Mason had Osteosarcoma, a rare bone disease. After a CT scan of his lungs, it was also discovered that he had cancer spots there as well. Mason was scheduled for a biopsy, and a port was placed on Thursday July 28, 2021. Mason also underwent a bone scan the following week which showed another cancer spot on his left hip and the presence of a blood clot in the hip area as well. We, of course, felt exhausted from the hours and hours of doctor and medical visits. However, we felt very blessed with the speed in which doctors led us to a rapid diagnosis that we later learned usually can take about 8-9 months of searching before the cancer is diagnosed. Osteosarcoma is a very distinct type of cancer that has a direct process of treatment. Even though much cancer research takes place, osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that has not had any “break throughs” in treatment over the last 20 plus years. So, we began the regimented course of chemotherapy cycles that have shown best results. Mason would begin a five-week cycle which would include extremely high dose infusions of three specific chemotherapy medications. This cycle would be repeated six times over the next 7-8 months. Mason also began twice daily shots to address the blood clot in his hip. The entire treatment process would require in-patient hospital care for each chemotherapy treatment. As eastern Idaho doesn’t have anyone who specializes in childhood sarcoma, we began traveling to Salt Lake City each time for treatment which would last anywhere from 3-6 days. Our summer abruptly stopped from the “regular” summer plans and activities, and Mason, our only child who has never had stitches or broken bones was quickly thrown into the medical world of poking, prodding, questions after questions from doctors and nurses, and basically any privacy that a regular 14-year-old boy would want and need was instantly gone from his life. Our other children also lost much of their normal lives. It's amazing to see everyone willing to adjust and change their priorities to help when crucial help is necessary. We have been able to make this work so far with the help and kindnesses of many friends, family and our community. Some highlights over the last few months: The student body president at Thunder Ridge High School reached out to me with support of the Parent’s Football Booster Club and asked if the varsity football team could host a “Yellow Out – Mason Strong” night to support Childhood Cancer Awareness and support Mason in his personal fight against cancer at their homecoming game against Rigby. It was an inspiring night to witness what the teens from our community put together. Not only did Thunder Ridge participate, but Student Body President, Max Leavitt reached out to the opposing team's student body president and invited them to join in wearing yellow to the football game. Yellow was everywhere that night. In a surprise addition, the Art Club also donated half of their concession stand earnings to the “Mason Strong” cause. Once this all got going, another friend of a friend, Kristi Carlquist offered to donate proceeds from drink sales from the Yeti Jane Drink Truck to the “Mason Strong” cause. It was a beautiful night to see youth join with adults from two communities (Rigby and Idaho falls) and to put together overwhelming support for Mason in a really fun and happy way. It was also extra special for our family to see support from the football team who all wore yellow socks and had yellow rally rags since Mason’s older brother plays football at Thunder Ridge. Mason Strong t-shirts and rally rags stating “No one fights alone” were created and donated by Leisle Rose of the Thunder Ridge Booster Club. As we continue along our journey, we will post periodic updates to this Caring Bridge blog. We are thankful and overwhelmed by  the tremendous amount of support we have received. Many of you have reached out to us asking how you can help. While it is uncomfortable for us to ask for help, we know that part of the journey includes providing a way for others to show their support for Mason and our family. In light of that, we've been meeting with a close family friend and members of the Idaho Falls Fire Department who are volunteering their time to help share information and provide opportunities to help out, including fundraising, scheduled meals, and even a lighthearted head shaving event that's in the works - all of which will be shared on this page in the coming days.

On August 24nd, Chris was admitted to Rancho Springs Medical Center in Murrieta Ca where he was diagnosed with double pneumonia as a complication of COVID-19. After a lung collapsed twice in one week and struggling to maintain his blood-oxygen levels, he was intubated and placed on a ventilator on 9/3/2021. A few days went by and his health continued to decline rapidly, his family was informed that he needed an additional life saving treatment called ECMO. (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation). He was placed on a wait list of over 100 patients, he was number 109 on that list. In that same week, his family got the call that there was a bed available for Chris to receive the ECMO treatment he so desperately needed!! He was airlifted to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla on 9/10/2021. Till this day, Chris is still on life support, he is still on the ventilator and ECMO machine but he is fighting hard to beat this! He has had a few setbacks but he has fought through them. He has been blessed with an amazing team of doctors, nurses, speech and physical therapists who are helping him recover so that he can come back home. The last few months have been extremely hard for Chris, his wife, his 12 yr old daughter and his family. He has a very long road ahead of him. He still needs to “graduate” and come off ECMO and the ventilator. His Drs have said his rehabilitation will be a lengthy one. He will need to learn how to walk, talk without the help of a passy-muir valve, get his basic motor skills back, learn how to write, hold things with his hands and get his overall strength back. It’s A LOT but he has been so focused and his progress so far has been nothing short of a miracle. His friends and family are continuing to pray and believing he will make a full recovery. His wife and daughter say Chris is the most determined, passionate and hardworking person you’ll ever meet. Before covid turned his life around, Chris was very active. He loved the gym, hiking, going on runs, working on his projects, reading and spending his days off with his girls. One of his biggest wishes after all this is over, is to be able to run another marathon! So, his family knows he is working incredibly hard to come home and get back to the life he loves. Besides his family, his wife and daughter miss Chris terribly and can’t wait for the day he is able to come home. So many people have asked how they can help Chris and his family and since we don’t know how long this journey for him will be, we thought we would set up this fund to be able to help with any travel, medical or any other expenses they may need. Please continue praying for Chris and his recovery, pray for the medical team treating him, and pray for his family.  I have had the pleasure to work with Chris Pineda at Mor Furniture. He is a high energy positive soul with a huge heart! His priority is his family and it shows in everything he does. His illness is heartbreaking. Chris could use some help. He was reluctant at first to accept. He has always supported his family. Under the circumstances of his current condition help is warranted. Please any and all donations help❤. If your family has been affected or not helping Chris is a good way to show compassion and or gratitude. Thank you in advance for your generosity ❤. *Please leave your personal messages to him at the end of the donation process   ",5965,8000,3 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/d46t8d-i-need-a-psychiatric-service-dog-please-help,"I need a Psychiatric Service Dog, please help!","I have been fighting a rare cancer, Appendix Cancer, since 2014. I was only 29 years old, and I am trying to survive past 37, where I am now. I have had several traumatic open abdominal surgeries over the years. The latest major one, in March of this year, resulted in multiple horrific complications that I have been forced to deal with ever since. The biggest complications are with the ureters connected to my kidneys. It's a lot to explain, but I am looking at possibly losing one kidney, both, or having permanent nephrostomy tubes in each one for the rest of my life.  I was also given both a permanent urostomy bag and a colostomy bag in that surgery. My body's actual physiology has been altered and my new life is difficult. Short of having a complete and total mental break, I decided I need a Psychiatric Service Dog that could help improve my mental state and will to keep on going. This type of dog is protected by the Americans with Disabilities Act and would be allowed to be at my side wherever I go. Just entering a hospital causes me to break out into a cold sweat. My hands get clammy, my heart races, and my anxiety goes through the roof.  Whenever I am given bad news, I actually dissociate and panic at the same time. My brain completely shuts off and that is why I always have a family member with me, as I stop hearing whatever else the doctor has to say. And all I've gotten this year is bad news after bad news after bad news. I have a port in my upper right chest. When it doesn't work, or a nurse starts to look at my arms for a place to try for an IV, I start to have a full blown panic attack where I can't breathe, the room spins, and I start crying involuntarily.  Because of all the hundreds of hours I've been placed under anesthesia, my memory is poor, especially short term memory. I often forget things someone literally just said to me, and I also often find myself desperately searching for the name of a common thing and cannot recall it for a while.  Having two stomas - my bowels literally poking out of my stomach - and two bags over them that fill with my bodily waste has made my social anxiety go through the roof. I am always afraid of going out in public in fear that I am going to be a freak show and people are going to stare and make fun of me. And I can't even change my bags myself - my husband or my sister change them for me, as I mentally cannot handle it. Thanks to covid, loved ones are not allowed to be with me or see me at night whenever I'm in the hospital. Having cancer and having bags and being left alone in a hospital always causes me extreme anxiety, depression, fear, and loneliness. I've never felt more alienated and alone in my life than in a hospital at night. These are just a few of the reasons I need a specially trained service pupper just for me.

They could go with me to my doctor's appointments, stay with me in the hospital, be next to me at home... It would really be a dream come true. This dog would be trained as a proper service pup to do things specifically for me, like remind me to take my medicines, interrupt a panic attack, give me pressure therapy when a panic attack is coming, offer his head and body for me to pet as I sob into their fur, give me a little more confidence in public as my ever present companion and an extension of myself, etc. If you have it to give, I would greatly appreciate helping afford one of these incredible animals. They tend to start at $20,000 due to the cost of specific training, board and food, vet costs, etc.  Please help give me a special dog that can support me where I am right now, and as my health continues to change.

I write to you as a mom…At approximately 11pm on Friday 8/27/21 I received a phone call from Ryan, my daughter’s adoring fiancé, telling me that my daughter had been struck by a car while waiting to cross the street. He watched her body flying one way and lower left leg another, the driver never stopping. A hit and run! When I arrived at the hospital she was already in the O.R., (Ryan never leaving her side pre or post-surgery) to stop internal bleeding and attempt to re-attach her traumatically severed leg. Over the past 4 weeks Ryan and I have mostly been at the bedside of our beautiful daughter and fiancee, thankful that miraculously she is alive and has not suffered brain damage or paralysis …and that we're able to hold the hand of her shattered body. When I say shattered, I’m referring to her traumatically severed lower left leg that could not be re-attached, her fractured neck that has now been surgically fused, her 2 broken arms, her pelvis, fractured in multiple places that was surgically wired back together, and multiple fractured ribs, which were surgically plated. She had been on a ventilator for approximately 3 weeks, had a tracheostomy, and a gastronomy feeding tube (ng tube). Jaci has also suffered bilateral pneumonia. She may yet need additional surgeries. We have been sustained by the outpouring of love and support from our family, friends, students, and colleagues. Jaci will need extensive rehabilitation and nursing care, which is how your generous contributions will be utilized. Thank you so very much!

We are small (comparatively speaking) but mighty and, like our friend, Mike Harrel, support strong. Mike was the parent that was always at the hockey rink to support his son and the team he played for. For those of us that know the family personally, we know what a kind-hearted man Mike Harrel was and how much he loved watching the boys (especially Mikey, of course :) play this sport that has captured all of our hearts. It's time for our communities to come together to support the Harrels as they are now trying to come to terms with Mike's passing. Mike lost his fight to Covid on Saturday, October 23rd, after fighting strong for the last couple of months. Mike will be tremendously missed among all who knew him, and the hockey community has lost a VIP member. Just like he was there for every game to video the boys and give the parents that couldn't travel the opportunity to see their kid play, Myra and her family need our help to pay for the mounting medical expenses that will be mounting up. We want Myra to feel loved and supported at this time. The best way for us to do that is to help with these unaccounted for expenses and loss of income.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/violets-village,Violet’s Village,"Abigail  Turner is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Victoria Kenney. Due to baby Violet’s recent diagnosis of ATRT - a rare, aggressive cancer of the central nervous system - we are asking the community who knows and loves Victoria and Brandon Kenney to support them through this extremely terrifying time. We appreciate you for showing your love for Violet and the rest of the family. Whether it is a donation or a prayer, it all counts. Violet’s Story: The precious Violet Reese Kenney entered the world earlier than expected by her mother Victoria and father Brandon on May 15, 2021. Victoria was 34 weeks pregnant when her water broke and she went into labor, and after a very exciting evening, beautiful baby Violet joined us here on Earth at 4:30AM. Due to her early arrival, Violet spent 3 weeks in the NICU following her birth. Every day Victoria and Brandon sat by her side in the hospital, helping her grow big and strong one day at a time. On June 8, 2021, Violet finally got to go home with her ecstatic parents and they could not have been more thankful. Victoria and Brandon spent the next three months enjoying every sleeping and waking moment with tiny Violet as she grew, her cheeks growing chubbier and her arms and legs getting the most adorable baby rolls as the days passed. After the three-month mark, Violet started smiling and babbling constantly to the delight of her parents. She was a happy baby who could be easily soothed by her momma and daddy. At Violet’s 4 month well visit to her pediatrician, a CT scan was ordered for precaution due to an abnormal head measurement. Victoria took Violet to get the CT scan, and before she and baby Violet could settle in back at home Victoria got an urgent phone call from the pediatrician and was told to take Violet directly to the ER at Norton Children’s Hospital in downtown Louisville. After waiting a long day in the ER, the pediatric neurosurgeon communicated that the CT showed that Violet had a mass of some sort in her brain that was causing hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluid in the brain. He said she would need an MRI to learn what the mass is and she would need immediate brain surgery in order to remove the mass as soon as possible.  On Friday, September 17, Violet underwent a 6-hour brain surgery for the tumor resection. The pathologist reviewing the MRI confirmed that the tumor was malignant cancer. Following the surgery, Violet stayed sedated and on the ventilator for three days as her body reacted to the surgery with continuous seizures. The medical team monitored her very closely as they tried to find the right balance of medication to stop her seizures and allow Violet to recover from the major surgery peacefully. These days were very difficult for all parties. Victoria and Brandon were faced with knowing their precious daughter has cancer for the first time. Violet was being poked and prodded with needles constantly, still suffering from seizures, and her parents were unable to hold her or comfort her meaningfully while she was still sedated and on the ventilator. On Monday, September 20, Violet’s team of doctors confirmed that Violet’s cancer diagnosis is ATRT, a rare aggressive cancer of the central nervous system. The gravity of this diagnosis is this: • ATRTs can be very fast-growing and often spreads to other areas of the CNS through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) • The relative 5-year survival rate for ATRTs is 32.2%  • ATRT patients will receive further treatments after surgery, which may include radiation, chemotherapy or clinical trials Violet’s treatment plan is being formulated now and will begin as soon as she rests and recovers from her major surgery, which could be as soon as two weeks. Victoria and Brandon are figuring out their plan for work and financial stability while also staying at the hospital all day and sleeping at the hospital every night, always by Violet’s side. They know that one parent will need to be available at all hours for Violet as she goes through treatment. Many of you have asked how you can help. Alleviating the additional financial stress the Kenney family will be facing will allow them to focus their care and attention on Violet, as they begin what is undoubtedly one of the most difficult experiences any parent can have. Please share this fundraiser with others and donate as generously as you can. ",78854,75000,27-Sep-21

They are well known and active members of our community. Elliot is a local Pharmacist working for the Olean General Hospital and has been active with the Olean Area Adult Hockey League. Whitney was most recently working for CABOCES with the Olean City School District as a Therapist before leaving her position to pursue her doctoral degree. Whitney is also part owner of MW Mental Health Counseling and has been a revolving member of several local bands including most recently for The Sticktights and The Chumps.

They received the incredibly devastating news that at the age of 31, Elliot has been diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer that has spread to his peritoneal area. He has already received emergency surgery and has started aggressive treatment. Initially they were hesitant to ask for monetary support from the community, but as both Whitney and Elliot have had to take leave from their jobs in order to care for Elliot's needs, expenses have already begun to pile up. We would like to ask the community to please help in supporting them through this difficult time in any way possible. This is not limited to monetary donations, so please be creative!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/fz3ey-help-the-castro-family,Help the Castro Family," Friends and Family of the Castro Family, As many of you know Roberto has had a very long battle with brain cancer. Roberto was diagnosed with brain cancer at 12 months of age. In 2012 he had his first surgery and radiation treatment. Following that he had clear MRIs until 2015. In 2015 the tumor came back in the same spot and his doctor removed the tumor once again. After that he became a patient of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and had on-going radiation and brain scans until 2021. In 2021 the tumor came back and this time was more aggressive, changing from stage 2 to stage 4. At that time St. Jude released him and told the Castro family that there was not much more that they could do for him. Fortunately after being discharged from St. Jude, they were able to get him in with a doctor at Dell Children's in Austin to monitor the growth of the tumor and learn more about hopeful options to gain more time with their son. His most recent MRI appointment showed that there are two small tumors growing aggressively. On Thursday, 10/14 they were finally able to get in with Dr. David Sanberg at Hermann Memorial Hospital in Houston, TX. The tumors had been causing Roberto nausea, vomiting, and ultimately he was admitted to the hospital because of hydrocephalus. On 10/18 he had his first of two surgeries with Dr. Sanberg and he will have his next surgery on 10/27. Following that he will start a radiation treatment on Nov. 1. Please join us in praying for complete healing for Roberto. That God would work through the hands of Dr. Sanberg to take out these tumors and that the treatment they have planned will prove to be effective. This family has been through so much and we want to do anything and everything we can to relieve the burden of extra costs as the Castro family cares for Roberto during this crucial time. We are continuing to pray for Roberto and the family. We believe God can heal him and this is our constant prayer. At this time their needs include hotel costs and costs associated with travel back and forth to Houston, extra medical costs, extra costs for health foods for Roberto and prepared meals. Mayela and Roberto will not be able to work their normal hours for their jobs during this time, so this is an added cost each month. We know many of you have been asking how you can help during this time.  If you would like to contribute to the needs listed above, please donate on this Go Fund Me page.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-julian-kick-cancers-ass,Help Julian kick cancer's ass!," Dear friends, It’s been a wild couple of months. Julian had already been a cancer survivor for 11 years when he started feeling a new pain in his groin. Eleven years ago, at 18 years old, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, which was treated with a surgery and some chemo, leaving him bald and immunocompromised for his freshman year at UW. He once sent me a photo of his student ID from that time. He wrote, “I look like my own thumb.” Fast forward to the summer of 2021, living in West Philly, where Julian started feeling a strange pain in his testicle. Given his history, we didn’t waste any time making appointments. After a number of scans and tests, we got a call about the results: a new cancer had emerged, same variety. Hearts sunk and heads spinning, we were left with a slew of difficult, surreal choices. After much discussion, we decided that it would be best for his mental and physical health if we returned to Seattle for treatment, to be with family and loved ones here for this staggering life change. His place of work has been astoundingly supportive throughout this transition. Since arriving in Seattle, his treatment at UW and Seattle Cancer Care Alliance has involved surgery, indefinite hormone replacement therapy, and three rounds of chemotherapy. He’s been receiving chemo infusions for the last six weeks, and he still has three more weeks to go. When he has the energy, he’s been enjoying playing board games and the occasional round of disc golf. When his infusions are over, he’ll have more tests and scans to see if the chemo did its job; we’ll let y’all know when the results come back. In honor of Julian’s 30th on November 1st, we are humbly asking for assistance from friends and family to help cover the costs he has incurred from the diagnosis, surgery, weeks of chemotherapy, and the on-going treatments, medication, and appointments that Julian will experience in the coming months. Thank you for your kind generosity. Sending love to you all. <3 ~ In full transparency, we wanted to let you know that we chose GoFundMe due to its legitimacy and trustworthiness. It also allows folks to view how much has been donated. We think that’s important. We also wanted to tell you that 2.9% of each donation, as well as $0.30 of each donation is taken by the for-profit business. If you were to donate $1000 to any cause on GoFundMe, GoFundMe would take a cut of $29.30. If you would prefer to avoid this fee, Julian’s Venmo is @Julian-Peterson-1. We understand accepting money on Venmo may muddle GoFundMe’s public data on how much has been donated, but we hope this option allows people to have a little more control over their money. While medical bills are still coming in, we anticipate the total cost of this event will amount to about $12,000. If we receive significantly more than that, we’ll be donating to the American Cancer Society. Thank you thank you thank you!! ",44842,12000,21-Oct-21

We so appreciate the outpouring of love and support already. It’s clear to see that Liz has a tremendously positive impact on everyone who knows her! Liz has been a public servant of Whatcom County for over 18 years. She began her career for the city as a page at the Bellingham Public Library, moved on to Parks and Recreation, the mayor’s office, and most recently as the Emergency Manager for the city of Bellingham.  COVID19 hit just as Liz started this new position and she took it head on with the same tenacity and grace that she does with everything in her life. Liz is a devoted single mom of our dear Luke. Have you met Luke? You may have without knowing it.... Luke was diagnosed with a very rare disease as a child that requires special care for his needs that will last for the rest of his life. Liz and Luke are a team.They are often seen around town in inflatable costumes, riding bikes, or swimming in some of Bellingham's hidden gems. On Tuesday October 12th, Liz had ""the worst headache she has ever had in her life"". After being rushed to the hospital from work, it was discovered that Liz indeed had suffered two major brain aneurysms. Our family was told that these were ""not survivable"". We prepared for the worst - friends and family rushed to Bellingham for the chance to say our goodbyes. But our girl ya'll...she is a fighter! Over night Liz fought for Luke and his future, overcoming HUGE medical hurdles. She was eventually airlifted to Harborview and now is awaiting brain surgery on Tuesday or Thursday, the 19th or 21st. Liz has spent the entirety of Luke's life preparing for Luke's care, if something awful was ever to happen to her. That time has come. Liz needs our help. Luke needs our help. We as a group of family and friends ask that you consider donating to this powerhouse of a woman and her sweet boy. I promise you that they are worth it! Medical flights, brain surgery, aftercare, rehabilitation, Liz and Luke's housing needs, and care during this time are just a few of the many ways we can all come together to help this woman who has greatly impacted us all! At this time there is no visitation or phone calls permitted. We are going to do our very best to keep you updated on Liz and Luke's situation via this thread.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/cagyk-service-dog-for-liam,Service Dog for Liam," Liam came into this world 13 weeks premature facing many obstacles from day 1.  He has been a fighter since the beginning.  Liam received services from Help Me Grow until age 3.  He then started in Occupational therapy, Speech therapy, and Physical therapy and continues those therapies today.  Liam has had so many amazing breakthroughs but he still has everyday challenges and struggles.  Liam is on the Autism Spectrum.  Some of his struggles are physical, some are social, and some are sensory.  Liam is struggling with focus both at home and at school.  His lack of focus mixed with his overall physical instability has caused him to have a number of falls in the past few months.  He had a fall so bad at Kings Island over the summer that the park paramedics needed to assist us.  He has had 2 falls in the classroom at school within a week.   His anxiety is getting worse as well.  He is always worried.  We hate seeing this since he has always been such a happy and loving kid.  We also experienced a very scary situation in a parking lot where Liam ran off from me and was almost hit by a car.  This was one of worst moments I have experienced as a mom.  I was holding his hand when this happened.  How did he get away from me?  Will he run off in a parking lot again?  I cannot take that chance.   We have been talking to amazing advocates, special friends, and doing lots of research.  We have all come to the conclusion that a service dog is the next best step for Liam.  A service dog will help Liam in a variety of ways.  It will provide physical stability and safety through tethering and a harness.  Hopefully this will prevent any further incidents in parking lots or on streets and also help him with stability at school and prevent falls.  It will fill a huge sensory need for Liam.  It will help to alert anxiety.  Liam does not advocate for himself and often cannot express when he feels anxious.   It will help with focus and calming.  It can help be a social bridge.  As Liam has gotten older other children are starting to bully him.  Liam has a very hard time making friends.  We are hoping a dog can help bridge a social and communication gap and allow Liam to make more friends.  It can help provide better sleep.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ben-beat-covid,Getting Ben Back on the Road," About a month ago, while traveling through Texas for a Gears and Gasoline road trip, my friend and co-host Ben Thorn was hit with a very aggressive case of COVID-19. The virus seriously damaged his lungs and added pneumonia to his complications. He was admitted to the hospital, and after a week he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where he has spent the better part of a month. He has fought hard to beat this thing, but without much improvement, his doctors and family made the difficult decision to sedate him, intubate him, and put him on a ventilator. It is beyond difficult to see this young, healthy, industrious, newlywed hooked up the machines and fighting for his life. For the last month Ben’s wife and mother have been with him in Texas. They are 1500 miles from their Virginia homes, waiting for his recovery. I am sure Ben will make it out of this, but he will have a long road to recovery. I want to make sure that when he gets home his only concern is to make a full recovery. There are a lot of layers to this situation, and I want to make sure that a financial burden is not one of them. Many of you have showed your support in many ways and have asked for a more tangible way to reach out to our friend Ben. Thank you. Your support means a great deal to Ben, his family, and to his Gears and Gasoline family. ",31576,40000,20-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/roys-benefit,Roy’s Benefit,"Austin Rust is organizing this fundraiser. Hi everyone, this is going to be very hard for me to type but I’m going to do my best. My name is Austin Rust and I have had the privilege to take care of Roy Howell with my amazing and supportive family. Roy was born with Down syndrome and has smiled since the day he was born. The amount of love that we have for Roy is indescribable, but more importantly the love that he has for everyone else is way more admirable. Roy loves WWE, Will Smith, Jamie Foxx, Days of our lives, His friends at special olympics as well as his friends at his day program, but the thing he loves the most is the everyday encounters he has with anyone who comes into his life. He is the most social person I have ever been around. Whoever you are, whatever your background Roy is understanding, open, and willing to talk to you as long as you’ll lend an ear to listen. About 3 weeks ago Roy had a sudden change in appetite and wasn’t interested in eating like his normal self so we decided to take him to his primary care doctor to check up on him. Upon some of the testing ordered a CT scan was ordered and that’s when the Boulder came crashing through our lives. We went from the doctor suspecting him being constipated to the worst fear we could ever imagine cancer all within hours. Because of the many locations of masses the original oncologist suspected lymphoma, but upon further testing and biopsy we have found out that Roy has a type of Stage 4 GI cancer. We are still undergoing more testing to find out specifics but what we know now is that the type of cancer he has is very aggressive and the treatment can only do so much. The prognosis from the oncologist is without treatment under 6 months and with treatment anywhere from 6 months to a year and a half we will have with him. So which leads me to typing this more emotional than I have ever been in my life. Roy doesn’t deserve this outcome and I will do anything in my power to make sure that he has the best remaining life that’s possible. Im not the type of person to put my hand out and ask for help but with the worry of not being able to give him what he deserves I reach out as hard as I can. He starts his first round of chemo on November 4th and has 2 minor surgeries before that. I wish I could give Roy everything he ever wanted but being realistic with the unknown upcoming medical bills, funeral expenses, and general costs that come along with this hell I’m not sure how well we can do that. I have never dealt with this experience and all I know is the information that is passed along from other people that have dealt with this terrible disease, and it is terrifying to us to see this bright star be anything but his highly optimistic self. We are keeping Roy’s spirits up by not burdening him with this terrible new found information, but instead trying to give him the world while we still can. Thank you everyone for the time you took to read this we are going to fight our butts off and Roy is the strongest person I know.   ",15940,20000,18-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-joshua-bair-cancer-battle,Support Josh Bair's Cancer Battle #FightlikeaBair,"Amy Barlow is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jaclyn Bair. To know Josh is to love Josh. Josh has worked hard his whole life. He is the kind of person who willingly drops everything to help others in need. He is the favorite uncle, best friend, faithful companion and constant comedian. He is a brilliant problem solver and a get things done kind of guy. His selflessness has blessed the lives of everyone around him. Now is our chance to give back and show Josh, Jaclyn and their three precious girls love and support as they embark on this unimaginable trial and as he fights for his life. On Labor Day, Sept. 6, 2021, Josh was experiencing a low-grade fever, abdominal pain, trouble breathing and pain in his shoulder. He was seen at a clinic in Idaho Falls and an ultrasound was ordered to be done the next day. Josh and Jaclyn thought he was having gallbladder problems and that it would lead to a simple inconvenient gallbladder surgery at worst. When the ultrasound was completed, they were told a softball sized mass was found and was concerning for lymphoma. The next day a CT scan revealed an irregular cantaloupe sized tumor and multiple masses in his abdomen. What they thought was going to be a common treatable problem began to take shape as something much more serious. Josh subsequently met with an oncologist in Idaho Falls and a biopsy of the mass was performed almost immediately. The results of the biopsy were even more unexpected and Josh was informed that he has a potentially devastating, extremely rare cancer (Metastatic Desmoplastic Malignant Blue Small Round Tumor) that predominantly affects younger men and has only been identified in around 200 people since it was discovered in the 1980’s. The cancer cannot be treated in Idaho and he was sent directly to Huntsman Cancer Center in Salt Lake City where he met with his cancer care team. He will be treated with one of the most intense chemo regimens out there and will start treatment right away. His battle is uphill and our hearts are aching deeply because of this news. We love our dear brother. He is the best father and husband. He and his family are going to need all the prayers, love, care and support we can offer. We are creating this page in the hopes that we can lighten some of their burden as they traverse through this life-altering trial. Please consider helping us reach our goal of providing some financial support to this sweet family so Josh can focus his fight on his difficult cancer battle. #FightlikeaBair ",24046,100000,24-Sep-21

Dean is always there if someone needs help… now he and his family need our help. Earlier this year, Dean was out for a hand surgery, then shortly after that he was hospitalized for Covid-Pneumonia and down about 6 weeks, which then lead to his diagnosis of MDS (Myelodyplastic Syndrome), a type of cancer/early stage leukemia. Dean started chemo treatments in Peoria (4 simultaneous shots in his stomach), but soon started traveling to/from the University of Chicago for more aggressive treatments and eventually admitted for a blood transfusion and stem cell transplants. He is considered High Risk and will have NO immune system and will need to be in isolation housing for 2-3 months (approx. $8,000 - $12,000 out of pocket) until he builds one up. His wife will also be off work (unpaid) and isolated with him as a caregiver. Dean has 3 kids, the youngest being his 11 yr old daughter who won’t see either parent until well after Christmas. We are raising donations to help with the lost wages from both parents being off work, travel expenses, expenses at home and cost for the isolation housing.

Hello, my name is AErin Graves and I, along with lots of other family friends, am helping to raise funds for Trina Schueller and her family. They have had a devastating start to the school year. Many of you know that about two years ago Carter broke his leg while playing in a football game. Unfortunately, it looked as though that nightmare would repeat this fall as well. On September 10, Connor along with the varsity football team traveled to the Sault for a Friday night game. That weekend Connor began feeling a bit sick. He ended up staying home from school for a total of two weeks. Thursday September 16, Carter and the JV football team had a game at home against Benzie. Unfortunately during that game, Carter was injured. What the family thought was a dislocated hip, turned out to be a fractured hip socket. This meant an air lift to DeVos where Carter was admitted and tested positive for COVID, although asymptomatic. Mike and Trina traveled down to DeVos to be with Carter while Connor still struggled with sickness at home. During the hospital stay post surgery, Mike and Trina also started to develop some COVID like symptoms as well. Fast forward to Carter being back home with his family, feeling pretty good health wise aside from the hip fracture. Connor is still sick, Mike is sick, and Trina is now feeling really sick. Trina’s sister and husband who are in the process of building a new house, have been staying in their camper on the Schueller’s property, have been helping out a lot. On Saturday morning September 25th at 4 in the morning Pam drove Trina to the hospital. Since then, Trina has been admitted, and been treated for COVID pneumonia. As we all know too well, COVID hits everyone differently. Unfortunately, it has taken a huge toll on Trina and the entire Schueller family. Trina has now been in the hospital for 12 days without an end in site. She is currently under medical sedation and on a ventilator to help put oxygen back into her bloodstream. She has been able to be woken up and answer yes and no questions quickly and also continues to demonstrate positive vital checks. Although we have been told she has a LONG road ahead, her nurses seem positive and encouraged by the amount of progress she has made thus far. When she is able to come home, it is going to be quite the recovery process. Though the family does have insurance, both Mike and Trina have been unable to work for a few weeks. They could use financial support along with LOTS and LOTS of prayers. Please continue with prayers and well wishes and if you are able, any donation amount will be greatly appreciated and helpful. Kingsley is a phenomenal community to live in. When things get hard and someone needs help, we pull through. Believe me, my family and I know all too well. Please help the Schueller family any way you can. We thank you all so very much, ❤️ The Family and Friends of Trina, Mike, Connor and Carter Schueller ",50420,60000,6-Oct-21

It's a thought nobody wants to dwell on - one that's easier pushed to the recesses of your brain. Recently, however, it's had to be front and center in the minds of the Lehner family. Mark was diagnosed with cancer. Though he had surgery to attempt complete removal, there is no guarantee, and the family is awaiting testing results to find out what stage the cancer is. During this time, Mark has had to close his business and does not know if he'll be able to re-open. The loss of income coupled with high insurance premiums and the hefty share of medical bills they are responsible for has created a financial burden that no family should face. If you feel led and can contribute to this gofundme, your kindness is so appreciated.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-lisa-survive-breast-cancer,Help Lisa Survive Breast Cancer," Hi there! I’m Kate, one of Lisa’s oldest and best friends. I’m also a member of her Breast Cancer Care Soul Sister Tribe. We love and admire Lisa’s grit, her relentless optimism, her boundless creativity, and her resourcefulness. However, we also know she can’t do it alone. So we’ve created this GoFundMe to raise funds to support Lisa and her young daughter Summer as Lisa undergoes treatment for breast cancer. Lisa was first diagnosed with non-invasive breast cancer (DCIS) in April 2018. Shortly after obtaining a second opinion from a renowned cancer hospital in Boston, she began ten months of comprehensive testing, which included multiple mammograms, ultrasounds, MRIs, and biopsies. She also re-committed to an intensive holistic lifestyle, which she found had once helped her successfully manage a benign pituitary brain tumor and two previously diagnosed autoimmune diseases. For several months, she and her providers continued to monitor the DCIS.In March 2020, just days before the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown, Lisa underwent scheduled follow-up testing. It was the news everyone dreads: her previously non-invasive breast cancer had progressed to a Stage 2 / 3  invasive cancer,  with a positive lymph node.  Due to restrictions on surgery mandated by the pandemic, Lisa began hormone therapy and underwent a battery of additional tests. She struggled with the hormone therapy, which her body did not tolerate well, but remained committed to her daily holistic regimen  -- eating a mostly organic and plant-based diet, juicing, exercising, and meditating daily. By October 2020, her tumor had shrunk by almost 35 percent. She felt encouraged, strong, vibrant, and ready to take on her next healing journey chapter with vigor. Unfortunately, life threw Lisa a few more curveballs. After a stressful winter that upended her family life, Lisa began a new chapter as a single mom. By spring, her tumor had begun to grow again.  Frustrated with the path she’d been on, Lisa sought out a new treatment team, with the goal of finding one that would more fully consider her complete medical history when determining treatment, and remain open to her continuing on her holistic path, now led by a board-certified naturopathic doctor. On September 8, 2021, Lisa began chemotherapy at Mass General Hospital in Boston. Though it’s been a long and winding road, she feels profoundly blessed, and remains confident that she is exactly where she’s meant to be. It means everything to Lisa, and to the people who love her, to see her at peace, to know that she’s in good hands, and to trust that her care team has not just her back but her whole body. Which brings us back to the purpose of this fundraiser. Chemo is not fun for anybody, but Lisa has endured a particularly grueling acute reaction to it -- a reaction so severe it necessitated delaying her next treatment so she had enough time to heal and recover her strength before she had to do it again.This only underscores the importance of providing Lisa with the resources necessary to ensure that she has what she needs to survive this treatment. She is grateful for the friends and family who have rallied to help with her various boots-on-the-ground needs, and would be grateful for anyone else who might be willing to participate in her healing journey by donating to her GoFundMe.In general, these funds will support:- Uncovered medical and holistic expenses- Monthly bills and utilities- Organic meal prep and fresh-made juices- Travel expenses to Boston for appointments and infusionsPlease help us help Lisa survive breast cancer. The world’s a far better place with her in it. Thank you for being here, for taking the time to read this, and for helping as you’re able.With love and gratitude on behalf of our Lala Lisa,Kate, along with Lisa’s Breast Cancer Care Soul Sisters: Kelley, Vicky, Allison, Lynda, Sarah, Melissa, Lindsay, Jennifer, Emma, + AnneTo learn more of Lisa’s story, please visit her blog at loverla.com and follow her on Instagram at @heyloverla.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/fundraiser-for-dan-walker,Fundraiser for Dan Walker," My name is Jarred Walker and I am fundraising on behalf of my parents Dan and Barb Walker. This past year has been one of the most difficult our family has ever faced. My father, Dan Walker, has been battling cancer (myeloma) for the past year along with quite a few other health issues. He has been hospitalized many times since January, some for weeks at a time. The cancer has responded fairly well to chemo; however, it has made other issues much worse. Unfortunately due to the nature of this being a blood cancer, it is not something that can be fully cured. In addition to him being a type I diabetic, his kidneys are functioning around 20%. He has been able to avoid dialysis so far, but it is still a looming threat in the future. In June he went in for a much anticipated back surgery that was supposed to alleviate some severe back pain he was having due to the cancer attacking his bones. The surgery was considered to be a success. However, the next morning he found that he could no longer get up and walk. The doctors think he may have had a stroke in his spine. Therapy has helped some, but it is unlikely that he will be able to walk again. If you are familiar with my Dad, you would know it has been especially hard on him as he is used to always being busy and on the go. He has been an extremely hard worker his entire life. His ongoing issues set off a domino effect of difficult decisions that had to be made. The biggest decision was that my parents would have to move from the home they have lived in for over 25 years as the house cannot effectively accommodate a paraplegic and is in need of repairs that they cannot afford to fix. We are currently in the process of moving them out/selling the property and have faced several setbacks which includes a failing septic system. In addition, my sister Danielle's family made the difficult decision to move from their ""forever"" home to a property that could accommodate a small dwelling next to their house so that she could be closer to help take care of my Dad who is currently living with them. As you might imagine, this whole situation has been emotionally and financially devastating. There have been many costs and unexpected challenges along the way. We expect those challenges to continue well into next year and beyond. Any help received is sincerely appreciated by our family. ",14570,10000,2 days

Adam and Annie developed COVID at the beginning of October 2021. He was hospitalized on October 10th at a local hospital where he stayed for about 9 days. At that point, he had developed pneumonia and his doctors felt it best that he be transferred to a hospital with an open ICU bed. To no fault of their own, that required a flight all the way to Minocqua. He was there for about 6 days when he was put on a ventilator and it was decided that he needed a higher level of care yet again. At that point, he was transferred via another flight to Milwaukee where he landed and began receiving ECMO. He started showing signs of improvement and was even able to get up out of his bed and into a chair which must have felt so good! As of today (October 27th), he is yet again intubated as his body is tired and needs the extra help still. Adam is a loving son, brother, friend, farmer, husband and FATHER to two beautiful little girls. The last three weeks have been trying in many ways for this family of four and I know they will appreciate any amount of financial relief from this unimaginable situation.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/THIRDxacharm,THIRD TIMES A CHARM,"Tiana Jones is organizing this fundraiser. Waking up Saturday morning, August first of 2021, Tiana Jones, 26, had the call she had been waiting five years for. Marking Tiana’s first discovery of a diagnosed heart disease, it was cardiomyopathy that began her entire life changing journey. During her sophomore year of high school, she had to pause her life from the things she had loved; her passion and dedication to the Mead High School dance team in Spokane, Washington being one. Knowing that she would eventually need a heart transplant within 10 - 15 years, though her health deteriorated quicker than the doctors had suspected. On May 4th of 2016 she was quickly admitted into the CICU waiting 12 days there for a heart transplant that ended up not working out. She had a dry run (getting a call for a transplant and leaving the hospital without a transplant). 40 days later the doctors decided an LVAD was the best and only option for her to live her life as the active adult she is and has always been. 15 hours into her LVAD surgery and 3 months of recovery, she was able to feel more normal than ever. This LVAD has given her 5 extra years of life, though there came many hard ships living with it. No swimming, no traveling (she had been relisted into the heart transplant list that encourages you to stay close to your hospital), no heart beat, relying on a 5 lb machine that was attached to either her shoulder or hip 24/7, always changing out the batteries to her LVAD and making sure a charger was near by to charge the drained batteries, carrying extra fully charged batteries on top of heavy emergency equipment that could not leave her side carried in a backpack at all times. There is no room for error when one is attached to an electrical machine that is helping a weakened life line- in this case; a failing heart. Tiana’s cardiomyopathy lead her to heart failure and this machine was prolonging her life, not curing it. Her health was still slowly declining and her heart was having a more difficult time pumping, so her doctors decided to insert a PICC line where a medication called Milrinone to help treat her heart failure. This lead her to having two machines to carry around and two opened wounds to take care of. Fast forward to July 30th of 2021, there was a call to her second chance of a new heart! She was sure of it this time. “This has to be the one!” It was finally prepping time in the CICU and just as soon as she had a second PICC line inserted the surgeon came in with their head hanging low. This was enough to know this was a second dry run. With her hopes high and refusing to have her second PICC line extracted, she manifested that they would call her the next day. And that is exactly what happened. This time she had priority over this heart. No dry run, no LVAD, no PICC line with Milrinone… Tiana Jones HAS a heart beat!! Third time’s a charm! There will be a long road to recovery ahead of her, though her heart team, her family, and she has been waiting and fighting for this very moment! Tiana can walk without a machine for the first time in six years. She can shower. She doesn't have to charge batteries to stay alive. She can swim. She can do so many things that many of us take for granted. Tiana has a year of recovery ahead of her, and is unable to work during her recovery. Her business which she opened despite the odds is currently closed. Tiana needs our help to financially survive while she rests and let's her new heart sync with her body, mind and soul. Anything you are willing and able to bless Tiana with will help her journey of recovery. Thank you for all the support and she can't wait to continue sharing her recovery with each of you!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/gdmjp3-we-humbly-ask-for-your-help,We Humbly Ask for Your Help,"Julie Danner is organizing this fundraiser. Thank you all for taking the time to read our story. I had hoped not to need to reach out for help in this way, but unfortunately we are in a position that necessitates a broader reach. We appreciate everyone for considering us and sharing our story. Our family is humbled and struggling. I didn’t want to burden anyone else to create this campaign for us, so I’ve swallowed my pride and here we go… I’m writing this on behalf of myself, my husband Jim, our beautiful 5-year-old son Andrew, my mom Nancy and brother Scott. We all live together and have put all we can into making our lives secure and happy, and filled with love and support for each other. However, we have come to a temporary place of financial need, and are asking for help. We are deeply aware of the devastating effects this pandemic has had on thousands of local Las Vegas families and millions of families nationwide. In March of 2020, I started a Facebook group to reach out and bring people together to help each other during such difficult times. Our group, “H.E.R.O. of Las Vegas”, has now grown to over 8000 members. During the last 18 months, we set up a community pantry, collected and disbursed food and household supplies, and provided holiday meals and gifts for every major holiday. Over 3100 families received grocery deliveries from our pantry, and more than 15000 local adults and children received help for holidays, birthdays, and back-to-school needs. Our group members have stepped up to fill thousands of their neighbors’ needs aside from what our little pantry has provided. So many people have come together to love and support each other to this day, and we are so grateful for, and humbled by, the true selfless and compassionate gifts of humanity the group has brought to our community. Unfortunately, for the past few months, we’ve had to take a step back from the group to handle our family and business needs. We are anxious to get back to the business of giving as soon as possible, but we still need time to recover our own life and get ourselves to a safe place, physically, mentally and financially. On August 3rd, I went in for a long awaited spinal surgery. I had been suffering for years with excruciating lower back pain due to a condition called spondylolisthesis, or slipping of the spine, as well as some less serious disc and nerve issues in the same area of my spine. I was nervous about getting the surgery because we had just had to move into a new home due to our homeowner wanting to sell, and my brother Scott had been in the hospital for almost two months battling sepsis and the ensuing lung, heart and kidney failure. Needless to say, we had a lot going on and the stress of it had taken a toll on us all. No one was prepared for what happened next, least of all, me. I came out of surgery paralyzed from the waist down in both legs. Fortunately, my right leg woke up within a couple days, but my left leg still hasn’t improved to this day. Instead of feeling in my leg, I experience unrelenting excruciating pain constantly, day after day. Jim (my beautiful husband) has become my full time caregiver, as I cannot walk, stand or do much of anything on my own, all the while caring for our son mostly on his own, and with grandma’s help. My surgeon has no idea why I’m experiencing this paralysis, nor any real ideas about how to fix it. My physical therapist believes it could be a year or more before I’m able to walk again, and gain regular feeling back in my leg. Meanwhile, my mom has taken on all of the responsibilities of tracking my brother’s care in the hospital, and is now training to become his full time caregiver at home, as he is finally set to be discharged next week. Jim and my mom have worked on unpacking boxes, keeping up on daily cleaning and meals, and have really pulled out all the stops to keep our little one smiling and our home running while I’ve been completely out of commission. Throughout these adverse times, Jim and I have not been able to handle and keep our business running smoothly, hence our income being effected severely. We also learned today that all of our unemployment has disappeared, not just the extra $300/week from the stimulus, which we had thought would be the case. This loss creates a $5000/month deficit in our income now, and we are at a loss as to how to move forward and pay our living expenses while I heal. None of us are able to leave the house and find full time work to make up the income because of my current state of disability and my brother’s total disability and the caregiving needs that come with it. I have desperately been trying to catch up on our business orders, but at this point I can only work about an hour at a time, a few days a week. On top of the paralysis, I’ve had two major debilitating falls on my dead leg, causing me to lose more work time and pushing my mobility progress back to square one. We have had to refund dozens of orders, and our finances can’t take any more hits at this point. We need your help. Our hope is that, with a few modifications and a little more time, we will be able to work our business more full time very soon. With the holiday season quickly approaching, our goal is to get my stamina and energy and mobility to a place where we will be able to maintain an income that will carry us through this tough time. I cannot wait to be able to increase my productivity and get our family back on track, financially secure, and ready for the future.  Again, I appreciate you reading our story, and ask that if you are able to contribute anything at all to our family, we are grateful. We understand that there are so many families struggling right now, and going through similar income situations with the loss of unemployment benefits hitting the whole nation hard right now. We would appreciate a simple share of our fundraiser whether you can help financially or not. Thank you again, and much love from our family to yours.  ",5446,7000,12-Sep-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/hdssvx-help-audrey-smile-again,Help Audrey smile again…," Audrey Shea began her freshman year in high school this year as many young ladies do. Active with sports, making new friendships, and planning which clubs she would like to join, in addition to finally being back in school since the Covid pandemic began.  Audrey is like so many other kiddos across America. She’s Fun loving, kind, filled with laughter and joy, and exemplifies the best in all of us.  She loves playing with her puppies and helping her dad with technology questions and assisting her mom with preparing tasty treats for others in the kitchen. Audrey absolutely adores her older sister. As school started, Audrey began experiencing a very sudden and drastic loss of vision in addition to daily migraine headaches and tinnitus. On Audrey’s birthday, September 15th 2021, after a trip to the ER, she was immediately transported to Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles, in a moment that will have forever changed the complexion of her life. After a battery of scans and tests, Audrey was diagnosed with a large gliolneuronal tumor that was growing in the rear portion of her parietal lobe of her brain. This type of tumor and its placement are so rare, that there are likely only a dozen cases across the world that can match with what Audrey has been afflicted with. Due to the heavy costs of multiple brain surgeries, and the extensive and protracted rounds of radiation needed to combat the aggressive nature of her cancer that Audrey is going to need to go through, the elevated costs are having an impact on the family.  The Redmonds are grateful for any gift that you can make, and they certainly are appreciative of every contribution, large or small.  Please consider passing this GoFundMe along to others so that they may be inspired by Audrey‘s story and help provide relief to the Redmond family during this difficult time.  Most of all, please pray for Audrey. She is literally all of our kids, and she needs your love and continued prayers.  Thank you for your kindness and generosity! The Redmonds need us to circle their wagon.  Audrey ❤️‘s you! ",38415,50000,7 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/dave-never-needed-us-more,Dave Never Needed Us More," Dear Friends and Family, Dave Belknap needs our help. As I write this note, Dave lies in a hospital bed in Milwaukee. He has been intubated and placed in an induced coma. On October 19th, while preparing for work, he began vomiting blood. His liver had failed and blood was filling his stomach and gorging his arteries. Two arteries in his esophagus popped and he found himself in a life threatening situation. Before passing out he managed to dial 911 and was transported to the local hospital where emergency procedures were taken in an attempt to identify his condition and prescribe appropriate treatment. Dave, we learned, has a condition called ""Hemochromatosis"". Normally, the liver would filter iron and toxins from the blood. But in Dave's case, iron was collecting in the liver where it did considerable damage and led to its failure. Dave was unaware of this condition. As you read this message his situation is improving but he faces a very long road ahead. He's already had a surgical procedure called ""TIPS"" and there will be more to come. There is a six month wait before a person can be considered for a liver transplant and it is unlikely that he will be able to work during the interim. How long it will take to find a qualified donor and what the recovery time will be is unknown. Folks, Dave and his family need us now more than ever before. If you know Dave, you know he is a fighter. Despite the setbacks he's faced in life he's shown a resilience that is inspiring. He's generous with his time and help and loves to share a joke or a poke. He finds comfort and joy in the natural world and maintains a grateful spirit. If he's made you smile or laugh, taught you a skill, or given you a hand, now is your opportunity to help him and his family. All donations will go directly to Dave's Family.

The leg pain that their beautiful son Macyeo had been experiencing was caused by a tumor in his tibia. The past two weeks have been overwhelming, to say the least. Mace went through diagnostic testing at St Louis Children’s Hospital. The diagnosis is an aggressive bone cancer called osteosarcoma. As of now, he is facing 29 weeks of chemo, surgery, rehabilitation, and physical therapy.  Carl, Lindsay and big sister Kyah are going to be with him every step of the way and plan to give him every support possible, including traditional and integrative medicine approaches. We all know he can beat this with all of us on his team.  Although they have insurance, they are faced with extraordinary financial challenges over the coming year.

He’s an amazing young man. He plays tennis, enjoys music, and is a big Oregon Ducks fan. We can help them get through this challenge together.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-mint-ralston-with-medical-expenses,Help Mint Ralston with Medical Expenses,"Jennifer Hobbs is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Stacy Ralston. Mint Ralston is a retired Marine who lives with his wife, Stacy, and their 8 year old son. He was physically active his entire life and enjoys the outdoors and spending quality time with his family. In 2017, Mint started having severe headaches that sent him to the hospital. A CT scan showed a shadow on the brainstem. In early 2019, Mint started having difficulty with fine motor skills and speech. He was seen by Duke Hospital in North Carolina, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and numerous neurologists in Charlotte where he lives. MRIs showed a lesion on his brainstem. Heavy doses of steroids were administered to no effect. Meanwhile, Mint's bodily functions declined on a daily basis. Doctors could not diagnose him without doing a biopsy but would not risk operating on his brainstem. Meanwhile, a shunt has been placed in Mint's skull to drain a constant buildup of fluid on his brain. Since emplacement of the shunt six months ago, Mint's decline has accelerated. He can no longer walk or stand and is wheelchair bound. He has lost his ability to speak and cannot communicate beyond ""yes"" or ""no"" that he conveys through hand squeezes. He lost control of his eye focus and can no longer read or watch TV . His ability to swallow is almost gone resulting in the recent insertion of a feeding tube. Mint's intellectual capacity remains unchanged, and he is completely aware of what is happening to him and his family. In September 2021, a neurosurgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Florida offered to do a biopsy since Mint's quality of life had deteriorated so much that surgery was worth the risk. Unfortunately, results came back inconclusive, and there are no treatment options moving forward. This is Mint's life now. Stacy is still working with the VA to increase Mint's disability rating, and resources from the VA will not increase unless Mint's rating changes. This is where we all come in. If this is his life going forward, let's help make it as comfortable as possible for him and his family. Mint and his family will need to make the house handicap accessible. They will need specialized equipment, such as a speech machine, so Mint can be an active participant in his young son's life. Thank you for your care and generosity. ",171838,200000,6-Oct-21

Yassin was born prematurely at 34 weeks. He suffered from respiratory distress and had to be in the neonatalogy intensive unit in a critical condition between life and death. When he came home, it was time of deep happiness and pure joy. But then just before his first anniversary, we started to suspect that something was off. Physical delays started to become apparent. Brain MRI introduced new vocabulary to our life: bilateral periventricular leukomalacia, spastic diplegia, disability and cerebral plasy. The first periods of shock and denial were harsh and took some time. After a lot of reading, we realized we were extremely lucky and things could have been a lot worse. Yassin a wonderful little boy; his cognitive functions are not impaired. We decided to move forward and promised ourselves to give him the best quality of life he deserves. We started physical therapy right away. Long hours of work, several intensives over three years. He even had a 3-week intensive therapy program at NAPA in LA, USA, in March 2020, just two days before the general lockdown because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now Yassin wears braces and is currently on a walker. Lots of progress, but still not enough. The spasticity in his legs is limiting his mobility and causing him a lot of pain. In the U.S., DR. PARK in St Louis (Missouri) has developed a surgery that can improve greatly the physical abilities of children with spastic diplegia. This operation would remove the spasticity and eventually allowYassin to WALK independently (though likely not on long distances). This surgery is called the selective dorsal rhizotomy (‘SDR’) and Dr.Park has performed it more than 4,700 times already. He has a unique technique which makes it really efficient. After sending our application, we received an acceptance letter that our little boy is a good candidate for the SDR surgery, and that he will also need an orthopedic surgery called PERCS right away after SDR. Both these two surgeries will change Yassin’s life. We are scheduled to submit the payment in December 2021, The issue is that this miracle is costly. Both surgeries cost around $60,000, without counting for all the other expenses (one-month stay in St Louis, intensive & compulsory post-op physical therapy, braces, medical equipment….). We need your help to fund this operation, which will greatly improve Yassin’s life. If you cannot donate, sharing this page and Yassin’s story is already a BIG boost and a first step for our little hero. Thank you so much for your kind help. ",19520,65000,2-Oct-21

Mike is a father of six, a grandfather many times over, and has been married to the love of his life for over 40 years. He has spent his life innovating in software and video games, and for the last several years he has headed up the Game Design program at Indiana University, mentoring the next generation of game developers. He is a graduate of the International School in Manila and Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Oregon, an active member of the LDS church, and a frequent Boy Scout leader. In spring of 2021, Mike began having migraines, followed by memory lapses. He increasingly had trouble concentrating and began to feel unusually tired. His wife, Jo Anna, took him to the Emergency Room twice in June and July before being referred to a neurologist. After an MRI scan revealed the presence of a mass in his brain, he underwent a surgical biopsy on August 24. On September 3, 2021, Mike was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma, located in the center of his brain, crossing both hemispheres. It is currently inoperable due to its location. A few weeks after his diagnosis, he began an aggressive course of chemotherapy and radiation treatments to slow and hopefully reverse the spread of the cancer. Mike and his family are facing a battle against this cancer, and with that comes a financial battle to cover the costs. In addition to covering the medical bills until his and Jo Anna's insurance takes over for this year and in the future, they will need help paying for procedures not covered by their insurance, gas for driving back and forth between Bloomington and Indianapolis for Mike's treatments, readying their house for sale, and the loss of his wages. Mike has spent his life engaged in creative pursuits and is known for his humor and quick wit. He has researched and developed innovative technology in the fields of video games and artificial intelligence, in addition to being a dedicated and enthusiastic teacher. He has been a driving force behind IU's Game Design program and the many young minds shaped there, as well as developing dozens of games and AI projects over the years. This cancer diagnosis has hit Mike and his family very hard, and derailed many future dreams. Your love and support during this time mean the world to us. Please give what you can.

My name is Ioanna Savvidou and I am fundraising for my loving friend Giwrgos Vagiannidis. Giwrgos Vagiannidis, 26, is from and currently resides in a small town of Northern Greece, Katerini. On September 1st Giwrgos received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at around 4pm. Per normal post vaccine procedure Giwrgos was told to wait 15 minutes and report any symptoms or issues he may have after receiving the vaccine. At that time, Giwrgos didn’t report any issues. Later at around 10pm he started experiencing a fever which at the moment he thought wasn’t concerning, however his fever continued to increase. By 4am his fever had reached 103.8 and thats when he was rushed to the General Hospital of Katerini. As soon as he arrived to Katerini Hospital he began to experience extreme pain followed by numbness in both legs. Katerini Hospital urgently transferred him to the nearest neurologist located at Papanikolaou Hospital in Thessaloniki due to a neurologist shortage; which was about 2 hours away. By the time he arrived to Papanikolaou Hospital Thessaloniki, he had lost complete mobility in both his legs. The same morning around 7am he was seen by 6 different doctors and he was told by both the Pathologist and Neurologist they’re was nothing abnormal about his exams, however he still had loss of all mobility and sensation in his legs. He was later admitted to Papanikolaou Hospital for 3 weeks so they could monitor him. While he was there they preformed 4 MRIs, 2 EMGs, 1 CT scan and a 24 hour EEG. At that point they still couldn’t reach a diagnosis so they decided to discharge him. They also denied him a referral for treatment at a Rehab center and any physical therapy. At this point he took it upon himself to begin treatment at Evexia Rehab Center in Thessaloniki. To this day he has completed 18 days of treatment, which he paid for out of pocket with the only savings he had. He has already seen slight improvement. His doctors strongly urge him to stay another month, however, the price of this facility is beyond any average Greek citizens means of $100 a day. Giwrgos has not been receiving any form of disability, unemployment or government help and has been out of work for 2 months with no sign of being able to return anytime soon without continued treatment. Giwrgos has no means to pay for this facility anymore or any form of financial support since both his parents passed in recent years. All donations made through GoFundMe will be given to Giwrgos Vagiannidis directly and will be used towards his rehab treatment and lost wages. ",4782,7000,7 days

""I could barely crawl,"" Smith, a Milwaukee native, recalled in a recent article detailing the event. ""It was like I was conscious, but I didn't understand what was going on."" Frightened and in desperate need of assistance, Henry tried to alert departing passengers from the arriving bus to his situation, at one point begging passers-by to call an ambulance as he lay prone on the sidewalk in a near-torrential downpour.Unfortunately, no one stopped to help him that rainy summer night. “What was so sad is I’m asking people to please dial 911 for me and they kept walking away. I’m lying on the ground getting soaked, and no one would do anything to help.""Henry mustered what little dexterity remained to call his fiancée Dana Wilson, who alerted emergency services and had him brought to Froedtert Hospital. After being checked out Henry was given the all-clear to return home, as doctors were unable to determine the exact cause of his symptoms at the time. Unsure of what else to do, Dana helped him back to his apartment to get some food and much-needed rest. As he appeared to settle in for the night she promised to come back and check on him first thing the next day and went to her truck to head home. ""Something didn't feel right to me about any of it -- I just couldn't bring myself to turn the key in the ignition,"" she reflected. After returning to the apartment she saw him struggling to ambulate and slurring his words, prompting a new call to 911 and a return to the hospital. Henry was kept overnight for observation and was rushed into emergency brain surgery early the next morning. It was discovered that he had suffered two strokes the previous evening, and he would return again to the operating table for another emergency procedure the following day before his eventual release, enduring over eight hours of surgery in all. Thankfully, Henry is now home again and on the mend, but he has struggled to keep the doors of his business open while he recovers. According to Dana, ""The landlord is trying to be patient with us, but before Henry can go back to the store, we have to make sure his health is intact first."" She has been doing her best to keep things running in his absence, but with the family's attention necessarily focused on Henry's condition and the progress of his early recovery, it's been far from easy. To hear it from Henry himself, the struggle is about so much more than his physical well-being. ""This isn't about pride. It's about being responsible,"" he recently told Princess Safia Byers in an article published by Milwaukee Neighborhood News Service. ""I love being at the store and I really miss it."" About the Toy Dimension The Toy Dimension has been a pillar of the Milwaukee business community for nearly twenty-five years, and Henry himself has been a veritable wealth of information regarding all things comic and movie-related for far longer. A black entrepreneur and longtime fixture on the collectible scene, his shop has become the premier local hangout for a diverse array of customers -- the young and the young at heart -- to trade stories on all their favorite superhero memorabilia, not to mention the only place in town to shop for the one-of-a-kind movie and action collectibles he regularly keeps in stock. Additionally, Henry has also served as longtime host of the bi-monthly collector's event at the historic Burnham Bowl across town -- one of the oldest comic and collectible series in the city -- since 1990, helping to introduce new generations to all the comic books, action figures, and characters he's loved all his life. What You Can Do to Help Simply stated, Henry and The Toy Dimension are in need of some assistance. While we’re glad he’s on the long road to recovery, the bills keep coming due. Unequivocally, it's a tragedy that none of our fellow citizens heeded Henry's calls of distress on the streets of Milwaukee that fateful night -- and now's our chance to make things right and lend a helping hand to a wonderful friend, neighbor, and entrepreneur. All donated funds will be principally utilized to pay the rent and utilities for both The Toy Dimension and for Henry's apartment during his long recovery, allowing him to focus on building the strength necessary to return to work on a part-time basis when given the clearance to do so by his medical team. The recovery process from having a stroke is multifaceted and complex; Henry will need adequate time to regain functionality, which can take many hard months of grueling rehabilitation and will likely stretch far into 2022. As he will be unable to return to work for some time, any and all donations that you can provide are both greatly and humbly appreciated. Additionally, any excess funds will be utilized to cover the considerable costs of his medical attention, including his two emergency surgeries and time in the hospital, along with the ongoing rehabilitation services and twelve total medications required for his ongoing convalescence. While Henry is thankfully covered by his current medical plan for the duration of 2021, his insurance status will then be in jeopardy at the beginning of 2022, and losing The Toy Dimension would be a tremendous blow to his ability to obtain necessary care. Henry was laid off from his second job during the pandemic in 2020, and losing his store so soon thereafter would have a disastrous effect on his health and well-being -- not to mention the void it would leave within the hearts of so many loyal patrons and the community at large. Let's Keep the Toy Dimension Up and Running! As the old saying goes: do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life. Indeed, while Henry has certainly never been a rich man, monetarily speaking, he has nevertheless always considered himself wealthy in a far more meaningful way. ""I love what I do. I don’t make a whole lot of money. But I love what I do...When I see a kid come in and get a big smile on their face, that’s worth it.” Let's help lift up a member of our community and share the wealth, Milwaukee. We hope you'll consider donating to Henry and The Toy Dimension as a thank you for all that he's given us over the past quarter century and help us keep the doors open to a place that comic fans of all ages can congregate for many more years yet to come.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/q73am3-help-axel-fight-sma,Help Axel Fight SMA,"Audrey Chen is organizing this fundraiser. Hi everyone, my cousin Jessliyn and her husband, Sadikin Alfian recently found out that their first born is suffering from SMA type 1. This is a disease that causes muscle weakness, a weak cry, and breathing distress in new borns. These babies have increased risk of aspiration and failure to thrive. They are desperately seeking for help for the treatment of their baby, Axel. Please hear out what Axel has to say and if it touches your heart, as it does ours, it would mean the world if you donated towards the cause. (Since Axel's parents reside in Indonesia, they cannot create a Gofundme page; therefore, I have decided to step forward and manage one for them.) A Letter from AxelDear world, my name is Axel. I was born in January 2021. I am the first and only child in the family, and as any firstborn, I am lucky to get the most attention, toys, and love from my parents.Like other children, I grew up normally. I like to smile and giggles, and learning new tricks on the first 5 months.However, my growth was going south around my 6th months. Daddy & mommy started to notice that I was struggling to do my normal tricks especially when it comes to lifting up my head which I have mastered a long time ago.Quickly they brought me to see many doctors, running tests on my blood, x-ray, nerve functions, and DNA. It was the scariest things of my life to go through ☹After weeks of waiting for the results, the truth finally came. The day that entirely changed my life and family.I was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1. A rare genetic disease that affect 1:10,000 babies.SMA is a progressive life-threatening disease that will slowly take away my muscle ability. Almost of 80% babies with type 1 SMA will not see the 2nd Birthday due to respiratory failure. Even if I luckily survived, I will grow up disabled because I will no longer have any muscles to support myself. I may need life time assistance such as respiratory and feeding tubes just to stay alive, wheelchair to go around, and braces just to be able to sit straight. Doctor said SMA will not affect my cognitive ability, so I will remain bright, alert, bubbly little boy keen to learn and explore new things, and experience the world around me. However, there is hope for me to get a better and healthy future. A once in a life time gene-therapy called “Zolgensma” with a hefty price tag of USD$2.1million. A big price that my parents have to pay to give me a second chance of normal life. This gene-therapy has saved many of my friends with SMA. However, I can only receive this treatment before my 2nd Birthday. Time is no longer in my favor. I do not want to give up that easily yet. Every day I trained hard just to make sure that my muscle will not deteriorate at a faster rate. I cried everyday while training, it is exhausting, but I have to remain strong until I can get the treatment. Dear good Samaritan, could you please help my mommy and daddy to spread my letter and donate to raise the funds needed for my treatment? There are many things that I still want to learn, dreams to chase, and the big world to experience. I also don’t want to leave mommy and daddy side too early, because I know they love me so much. Thank you, Love Axel ",17300,700000,13-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/philips-fight-for-his-dream,Philip's Fight for His Dream,"Anita Bova is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Tina DiBlasi. Philip’s Fight for His Dream Hello Friends.  My name is Anita and I am the proud aunt of Philip DiBlasi, Jr.  My sweet, humble, kind, nephew, Philip, has been diagnosed with cancer, specifically, medulloblastoma, a type of cancer most commonly found in the cerebellum, the part of the brain located at the back of the skull.   The tumor in his brain has been removed but he has a long journey to recovery ahead.  I am raising funds to help my sister, Tina, and my brother-in-law, Phil, pay for medical bills that a cancer diagnosis generates so that they can concentrate fully on Philip’s healthy recovery and on taking care of their family.   After weeks in a rehab facility where Philip is undergoing intense physical and occupational therapy, Philip will begin radiation followed by chemotherapy and months of additional physical and occupational therapy.  The funds will help pay for what medical insurance does not, from surgery and the hospital stay, to medications and tests to the last days of chemo.  It is going to be a long journey to recovery and believe me, we are counting down the days!  We look forward to Philip’s return to Northeastern, to his Huskies baseball uniform and to the pursuit of his dream of becoming a professional baseball player. Philip was practically born with a baseball in hand.  He was hitting baseballs, catching baseballs, throwing baseballs as soon as he could walk.  Baseball talk dominated breakfast, lunch and dinner, especially during Red Sox-Yankees games!  Baseball was life and life was baseball.  He tried playing with and coaching his younger brother, Thomas, but Philip’s pitches were too powerful for the younger baseball player.  Philip’s dream has always been to become a professional baseball player.  He shuffled his parents to baseball practices, games, tournaments year-round, wherever they were held.  Tina, Phil and young Thomas never complained because they loved watching Philip play.  Thomas wants to be just like his big brother when he grows up.  Philip’s parents have sacrificed everything for their little boy’s dream.  Philip’s commute from Derry, NH to St. John’s School in the North End of Boston and later to Boston College High School never discouraged him.  He napped in the car, snacked in the car, and did his homework to/from school in the car or on the bus carrying the BC High Varsity team to games.  He was committed to his dream and to nurturing his gift.  His coaches saw something in Philip.  He had talent!  He had an innate God-given baseball talent that his coaches recognized.  As a high school sophomore, he was scouted and received a baseball scholarship to Northeastern University while winning baseball awards and accolades along the way.  His talent, hard work and resilience had paid off.  A big part of Philip’s dream had come true, until he was dealt a major setback. Philip had just begun his freshman year and a promising college baseball career at Northeastern University when the unthinkable and a parent’s worst nightmare began.  It all started with a phone call.  Philip had to undergo emergency surgery to remove the cancerous tumor.  We are still in shock!  It’s as if time has stood still.  We have shed many tears, have shared endless hugs and have prayed….a lot!  Philip is constantly on our minds as he continues his fight to strengthen his body and mind for what’s ahead.  We continue to pray and are confident in the doctor’s optimistic prognosis.  Philip is surrounded by his loving and supportive family and an amazing network of friends and mentors from his not-so-olden days at BC High to his new days at Northeastern as well as by teddy bears, cards, baseball paraphernalia and of course cookies…lots of cookies especially his favorite, Double Stuffed Oreos.  Philip has an amazing attitude, zest for life and drive to continue to pursue his dream of one day donning the much-coveted professional baseball uniform.  He has an excellent team of doctors from Mass General who are confident that Philip will recover.  Tina has lovingly referred to Philip as her “hero”.  Please help our hero in this, the fight of his life.  Please pray for Philip and his family!  Thank you and God bless! ",60978,150000,14-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-lisa-karlan-recover-from-her-stroke,Help Lisa Karlan Recover From Her Stroke,"Taryn Rasgon is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Adam Rasgon. When our mom, Lisa Karlan, suddenly suffered a massive stroke in April, her neurosurgeon warned us that she had a small chance of surviving the coming 30 days. What he said next was more disturbing: If she manages to make it beyond a month, she would likely face a bleak future in which she may not be able to eat food, speak, walk, sit in a chair or breathe on her own. Our mom not only survived those 30 days but she has miraculously made gradual progress in her recovery. She is breathing on her own. She is able to eat. She is speaking more coherently every day. She is able to sit upright in a chair. And most significantly, she took her first steps last week, raising hopes that she will be able to be on her feet again soon. Now, she is slated to be discharged on October 21 and will require an around-the-clock caregiver, additional physical, occupational and speech therapy and specialized equipment in order to have a chance at regaining her independence and achieving a decent quality of life.  Over the last six months, our mom has been unable to earn a living. Unfortunately health insurance only pays for so many days of care. She deserves more therapy, care, and equipment so she can continue to recover.  We hope as our mom makes steps toward becoming independent again, she will not require a full-time caregiver or additional therapy. But the doctors at the rehab facility — where she is currently residing — have been clear that they believe she will need a caregiver in the coming term and will benefit immensely from extra therapy over the next year. They have expressed optimism that she will continue to make improvements and ultimately recover her ability to support herself. Our mom’s parents died when she was young and she is an only child. It is incredibly discomforting for us to turn to friends and family for financial assistance for her but we want to do everything we can to give her an opportunity to live the best life possible.  Throughout her life, our mom has gone above and beyond for her friends and family, often making sacrifices that few other people would be willing to make. She has never asked for anything in return, taking satisfaction in the feeling that she was able to help the people she cares about most.  We are grateful for anything anyone can provide and we believe every donation will make a tangible difference for our mom and enable her to become her old self again. More Details On Our Mom’s Story: In April, our mom was rushed to the hospital after she suffered a massive stroke. Surgeons quickly performed a procedure to drain the accumulation of blood in her brain. The operation successfully extracted much of the blood, but rising pressure in her skull compelled the surgeons to carry out a second procedure in a matter of a few hours. In the following days, our mom contracted two hospital-acquired infections. Still in a coma, her shoulder was dislocated when a nurse hastily tried to reposition her. For a third time in less than a month, she returned to the operating room where doctors popped her shoulder back into place. Despite these setbacks, glimmers of hope started emerging. She began breathing on her own, freeing herself from the ventilator that had kept her lungs working for more than a month. She subsequently made subtle movements with her left hand and leg followed by more significant movements.  But just as our mom appeared to make strides in the healing process, she encountered more obstacles. After being discharged from the hospital, she was transferred to a rehab facility where she was neglected most of the day, receiving little therapy. She would frequently be ushered into a hall where fellow patients would play bingo while she would be fast asleep -- an activity that the facility’s staff told us was therapy. Still, our mom continued to show signs of recovery, increasingly moving her left leg and arm and commanding greater alertness. Witnessing the facility leave our mom to languish, we were convinced we had no choice but to find a way to relocate her to a better place. The only solution was to switch our mom’s health insurance in hopes that she could be admitted to one of the best rehab institutes in California. Following hours of long phone calls and filling out a copious number of documents, we succeeded in changing her insurance and receiving approval to transfer her to a new rehab facility where several hours of intensive therapy are offered daily.  Following her arrival at the new center, she quickly made progress. She not only began to eat food but to speak. But she still has a long way to go in order to speak fluently because she suffers from a condition called aphasia which means she often jumbles her words.  More recently, she regained the ability to move her right arm and leg and is now working tirelessly to walk again. With assistance, she took her first steps last week!  But some parts of her experience since moving to the new facility have not been a walk in the park. While examining our mom last month, a doctor noticed her shoulder had been dislocated. She was immediately taken to the hospital where another doctor used too much force trying to pop it back into place, breaking her arm. Yes, a doctor broke her arm! The break was so significant that she had to undergo surgery to fix it. A few weeks later, she underwent yet another surgery to restore the part of her skull that had been removed shortly after she suffered the stroke.  Despite it all, our mom has continued to make progress. The road to her recovery has been undoubtedly bumpy but her doctors remain confident that she will continue to heal and hopefully lead an independent life in the future.  We have witnessed our mom surmount hurdle after hurdle with so much strength and grace. She has proven time and time again that she has the will to make it through this storm — a will to live, to heal and to return to our lives. Feel free to contact us with any questions.Thank you for your support in helping our mom!Taryn, Adam & Michael ",42876,200000,15-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-contributes-towards-bills-cancer-treatments,Help Bill Fight Cancer,"Team fundraiserKristen McClurken and 2 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jenny Mahoney. After being together for more than a decade, Bill and Jenny tied the knot in 2019. Unfortunately, they had to delay their dreams of honeymooning in Japan and expanding their family due to the onset of a now all too familiar global pandemic. Jenny oscillated between being out of work at the hospital and bravely working directly with Covid patients throughout 2020. Just when Bill and Jenny were picking up the pieces from a crazy year, Bill was diagnosed with an aggressive form of testicular cancer. In addition to the shock of dealing with a cancer battle and the heartache of putting their dreams on hold once again, they have learned that health insurance doesn’t cover all the necessary expenses. Between weekly chemo infusions, travel and lodging across state lines, Jenny missing work to be by Bill’s side, and unexpected medical procedures as a result of extensive testing (e.g., oral surgery, cardiology, pulmonology and family planning visits), having cancer is expensive. Your support will help Bill get the treatment and care he deserves, as well as help Bill and Jenny build back up their savings to allow them to one day go on their honeymoon, buy their first home, and expand their family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/mayas-medication-to-give-her-more-time,Maya's Medication: To Give Her More Time," This is a NEW Go-Fund-Me Page. I would like to start off by thanking everyone who donated to Maya's previous Go-Fund-Me page. Hi Everyone, As most of you know, on 12-04-20 Kim & Shawn's daughter Maya, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor (DIPG). DIPG is a rare, fast-growing tumor that forms in cells called glial cells in a part of the brain stem called the pons. DIPGs tend to spread to nearby tissue and other parts of the brain stem, are hard to treat, and have a poor prognosis (outcome). Maya was given a prognosis of 8-11 months. From her date of prognosis, Kim & Shawn have not stopped fighting for their Sweet Little Maya. On 01-02-21, Maya did an 8 week cycle of radiation at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. While waiting the necessary weeks to see the results of the treatment, they were able to get her in a trial drug study in New York. On 02-27-21, she started the ""ONC201"" trial drug in New York but in the middle of July Maya was taken off of the trial when she lost the ability to walk and talk. At this point the doctors decided that she should start a 2nd round of radiation. This time Maya completed a 6 week cycle again at Brigham's in Boston. After this last round of radiation and due to the aggressiveness of the tumor, Kim and Shawn were only left with one option - to put Maya on a daily medication routine. The doctors wanted Maya to take 2 different cancer treating medications to try and slow the tumor down. The doctors submitted both medications to the insurance company. The first drug (Everolimus) was approved and the other was denied. The drug that was denied is called KISQALI. The reason for their denial..... because it's a breast cancer drug. Yup! That's what I said! Ridiculous, Right?! The doctors appealed the decision with the insurance company twice, even getting letters from head of oncology at Dana Farber stating that this breast cancer drug has been used to treat pediatric cancers and still they were denied coverage of the drug! I love Kim and Shawn very much and I love Maya more than anything and I'm not going to let an insurance company decide her fate. This medication will not save Maya's life, but what it will do is try to slow the tumor down.  This will help give Kim, Shawn & Abby more time with Maya. The monthly out-of-pocket cost for KISQALI is $5,660.75. Kim and Shawn are exhausting all of their resources to try and come up with the monthly payment for this medication. I want to help alleviate their financial burden so all they have to focus on is spending their precious time making memories with Maya. Please help me do this by donating what you can to Maya's monthly medication bill. Giving A LITTLE is Giving A LOT! Thank You to Everyone in advance! ",13050,20000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/momma-gwyns-cancer-emergency-fund,Momma Gwyn's Cancer Emergency Fund,"Nicole Toolan is organizing this fundraiser. Hi Everyone, I'm Nikki and Miss Gwyn is my mom. As most of you probably already know, she was diagnosed with Lung Cancer in April of 2021. Due to the lack of medical insurance, she was passed around from doctor to doctor and only pain management care until July 23rd. She received an operation to remove a mass that had developed in her intestines but due to the untimeliness of her care, her intestines struggled to return proper functions. She is still battling with the masses in her lungs that are keeping her from receiving sufficient oxygen levels and a mass in her stomach. She was rushed to the hospital on August 21, 2021 and was placed on another drainage tube. Her lung was holding 20 oz of fluid in under 24 hours of the first being removed. She is now dependent on oxygen rather than supplemented. I am currently waiting to hear from her palliative care team to be given a timeline. Based on how quickly her health is changing, the situation is urgent.  Since COVID is rampant in Florida, her hospitals won't allow visitors. We are fundraising to get her transferred to a care facility that will allow us to spend time with her. Other funds will be used for the oxygen and medical treatments she will need. In the worst of cases, the funds will be used to give my mom a respectful burial. This gofundme is getting started so late in the process due to my inability to put the situation into words. It is hard to actualize it in text while trying to remain optimistic. I know everyone is experiencing financial stress and I don't expect to receive much but even sharing kind words or a story about my mom is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read our story and if you'd like to be updated, please feel free to reach out to me. With love, Nikki ",7740,10000,24-Aug-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-cc-after-becoming-paraplegic,Help Paralyzed Man on Healing Journey," Family and Friends, On October 19th, we received devastating news. CC, a father, brother, son, and uncle had been shot. Immediately upon arriving at the hospital it was evident that he was paralyzed or had extreme nerve shock. He couldn’t feel or move anything from his belly button down. CC is one of the most positive people you could ever meet and on that day his world was turned upside down. After surgery it was confirmed he’d never walk again. The sad realization set in that he will never be able to jump up and down to cheer on his daughters as they make future accomplishments, he’ll never get to race them to show who’s faster, and he won’t get the opportunity to walk those two beautiful girls down the aisle one day. CC has spent his life trying to make everyone smile and laugh. Even through this he remains positive, but now he desperately needs your help. His home after hospital release will require major updates to accommodate his wheelchair and new daily needs. In addition, he needs to continue his physical therapy after release in order to gain some level of independence. Unfortunately, obtaining Medicaid to assist him is a lengthy process and he will soon be dropped from his health insurance coverage. Because of this we’re asking for your help to raise $15,000 to cover his post hospital release. I’m sure there’ll be many more things we haven’t realized but here’s just a few things your contribution will help with: -Required doctors visits -Required physical therapy -Reconfiguring bedroom and bathroom to make it wheelchair accessible -Installing ramps at necessary entrances -Widening door frames -Making appropriate vehicle updates Please help us help CC, and let this journey be one that ends in success. Along with your prayers, please consider making a donation so that he can begin his journey to healing and work to regain a sense of normalcy. We would love nothing more than to tell CC that people who care about him and wish to help him came together to make this journey a bit easier for him. He’s dealing with a lot physically and mentally and I’m certain your contribution of any amount will help lessen the mental and financial burdens he will face.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/silasstronger,Silas Strong,"Team fundraiserAnna Harris and Christina Cobb are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Dan Cobb. https://www.facebook.com/groups/silasstrongerHello, my name is Anna and I'd like to tell you about my best friend and her son's fight against a lethal brain cancer that has a very poor prognosis. It's a rare malignant brain tumor called Gliomatosis Cerebri. I've been friends with Christina for over a decade. That entire time, Silas has been the light of her life, they’re best friends. Before Dan, it was just the two of them, and when Christina wasn’t working and Silas wasn’t in school, they spent all their time together. Because of that, he’s really not your typical eleven year old, he’s more mature. He’s also intuitive, empathetic, sweet, loving, and even though he seems older sometimes, he’s still a goofy kid that can make anyone laugh. When Christina met Dan I was so happy for her. And Silas. She’d been a single mom ever since Silas was a baby. Silas loves Dan so much, anyone can see what a special relationship they have. Silas finally had two best friends! Dan and my husband Michael also have a lot in common, they both play tabletop games, so we easily all became friends, we often enjoy barbecues and game nights together. For a while it was nothing but great times. During the height of the pandemic, Christina and Dan did what so many other people did, they made the decision to not let COVID slow down their lives. They got married. They had their second kid, Elena, on June 2nd 2021, and everyone was so happy. Silas is the best big brother. Right away he was offering to watch her, to help entertain her, and he can’t seem to get enough cuddles with her. Life was perfect. A month after Elena was born, Silas started to complain of weakness in his left hand. The University of Michigan pediatric hospital is one of the best in the country, and not that far from us. They did the right thing, and took him there. It’s been a long diagnostic road that included a number of stays, neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuro-oncologists, lumbar punctures, CT scans, MRIs, and finally a brain biopsy. Roughly two months after the first stay in the hospital, they got a diagnosis. It’s a rare presentation of a Glioblastoma called Gliomatosis Cerebri. An aggressive brain tumor. There is no cure, and there are very few long term survivors.  No one can really imagine seeing their child go through painful procedures and hospital stays. No cancer is easy, especially for a child. Kids can be brave, but what he will go through would be terrifying even for an adult. Christina and Dan have told me just a little of what Silas has gone through so far, and I knew I had to do what I could to help. This is just the beginning.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/greg-coyle-medical-fund,Greg Coyle Medical Fund," Hi, my name is Lisa Coyle and I am fundraising  for my husband Greg Coyle.  On August 14, while we were on vacation as a graduation gift for our daughter, we received a call that our dog's stomach had flipped. We had a decision to make let the dog die without us by his side,  or let them perform a surgery and save him. My husband opted for the surgery even though the dog was 13 years old,  but it was his first pet and loved him dearly.  The surgery was $3,000. We were flying home the next day and my husband did not want him to die, but if he was not going to make it Greg had to be there to be with him so he would not die alone. Our dog was then transferred to a 24 hour care facility which costed $1,400 a night. He was there for two nights and died anyway.   While all of this was happening, Greg was not feeling well and decided to get tested for COVID and came back positive ( our entire family did).  I decided to get an oximeter and when we checked on August 20, Greg's oxygen level was 67. He went to the ER and they admitted him to ICU. He was there for 10 days with COVID related pneumonia and had a 50/50 chance of surviving. He slowly started to feel better, however even when he was discharged home he was still on daily oxygen treatment.  As things started to look better he started to have a chest pain and decided to get it checked on October 20.  His doctor decided to run labs on him, and then called right away to let him know that he was having a heart attack and that he needed to go to the ER immediately. The hospital performed a CT scan and notified us that Greg needed an emergency quadruple bypass surgery. On October 21, Greg had the surgery and was then sent home on October 24.  While COVID put him out of work since August 16, the bypass surgery has now added an additional 3 months. I am working but cannot carry us both as he is the major bread winner.  To anyone who knows me, knows that I never like to ask for anything ever. I have always been a giver, however at this time I have to reach out and ask for help as we are in a desperate need. Greg's parents have been able to help us until now,  however his mother recently had a heart attack herself and she is in a rehab facility. Yes, when it rains it pours and it's our turn to be in the storm.  Thank you for any donation that you can make, along with your prayers, and sharing this link to help our family. God Bless!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/urgent-debbies-transition-fund,URGENT: Debbie’s Transition Fund,"TJ Travis is organizing this fundraiser. Deborah Crankin is a 22 year old transgender woman working as an artist on a music project featuring some of the top producers in Los Angeles, California. Listen here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiUVZA3Pk-Ci7lSUMfdbd4V9D3PX33NAr  Before pursuing her own endeavors, she worked behind the scenes for new age experimental art spaces such as ""Artechouse"" in Wahington D.C., and artists such as Taylor Swift, Jay Z, and Beyoncé. She is also credited as a footage contributor for organizations such as the University of British Columbia, Viceland, NBC4, and MAPS. Growing up, I had to deal with an internal battle of the greatest kind; one that entailed my sense of identity since who I identified as and the way I was born were at parallel odds. You see, I always knew I was a girl with a passion for all that was beautiful and bright in life from a very young age. However, my family never understood what I was going through and the inner turmoil that arose from being continually forced to be the son that was born into the unit. Yearning for acceptance and the love that I needed during this difficult time and getting the opposite in return forced me to grow up, fast. Sadly, when I began my transition at the age of 20, I still did not have the support of my family at all as they were completely not interested in trying to understand me. Instead, they kicked me out of the only home I had ever known in December 2019 which totally left me on my own to face a very big world. A physical altercation ensued between myself and another family member who attempted to use a weapon against me. I had to defend myself and I panicked and entered fight or flight mode. I was then arrested and kept overnight in a jail in Upper Marlboro. I was told my family member was pressing charges against me as well as my own Mother getting a protective order against me. I battled in court for nearly 2 years and was denied many jobs after hundreds of applications and interviews that lead nowhere due to what was on my record during background checks.   Since then, I sought refuge with friends from Cleveland to Richmond, and back to Washington DC where I rented rooms from strangers on the Facebook marketplace. As I tried to sort out my living situation, I got lucky and worked for an experimental generative art space in Washington DC but got laid off due to the Covid-19 pandemic. I was therefore unable to support myself and my transition, and did not receive a stimulus check or unemployment check for quite some time. My efforts to follow this up by contacting government delegates proved futile since I never got any response. In the 10 times I had to move, I experienced racism, homophobia by former landlords, and was at one time crammed in a tiny room where I couldn’t even walk to stretch my legs when the lockdown began - wreaking havoc on my mind! It got to a point where all the stress and anxiety caused me to throw up on the floor one night, thinking how my life was finally about to end. This left me with a decision to make having acknowledged that all these unfortunate events were derailing my progress in life, my transition, and career as a creative. My desire was to start afresh in a new area where I would be able to connect with people who are like me and where I would finally be myself both as a person and as a professional with no isolation or alienation. Moving across the country after raising a decent amount of funds, in a white Ford transit connect cargo van from Maryland to California, was the most awesome experience ever! While there, I started to slowly figure myself out including experimenting with some photo shoots and creating some music here and there. After two months here, I was able to meet some of the top producers in Los Angeles who helped me to develop my career. However, my life in LA hasn’t been without its fair share of woes having battled homelessness for a little over 4 months in living here  as most of the funds I raised ran out. Having faced adversity in the first apartment I got which stifled my creativity, I began looking for another location that would support all my plans in addition to having a place to live. Unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned. I lost my wallet with my ID and debit card which is how I ended up out on the streets and living in a very unsafe area. Local organizations like the Los Angeles LGBT Center and the Trans L@tina Coalition could not be trusted and their references for shelter put my life in grave danger. My worst nightmare was when I was assaulted on three separate occasions by a transphobic black males. After the third encounter, I was illegally detained by the police where my basic rights were ignored, I was nearly sexually assaulted by an officer of the law, and I spent over 2 days in-between jails across Los Angeles. That was a very traumatic experience. As of now, I am currently just in between hotels. I am trying to secure a stable home and my own transportation again because I sold my van due to the issues I was having with it. This is where you come in and Why your support matters: Despite all that I have been through and survived, I still believe that I have a purpose in life and a reason to live now more than ever. What I want most of all? To be the woman I was meant to be, as free in my own skin physically as I am emotionally. In order to achieve this, I will have to undergo a medical transition which will truly liberate me. This is an extensive surgical procedure that has so many aspects to it including tracheal shave, breast augmentation, facial feminization surgery, liposuction, rhinoplasty, and finally male to female gender reassignment surgery. But that is not all, there are the after-care needs to consider too including regular fitness and voice training given the impact of hormone replacement therapy on the cardiovascular system,transportation, housing, and other needs like maintaining the body with laser hair removal and other beauty costs.  Dr. Weimer grew up in Seattle, where she developed her first love of science and water. She then attended Brown University in Rhode Island where she majored in neuroscience and played water polo. She attended medical school at UC San Diego. She completed her residency in Internal Medicine and Pediatrics at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, followed by a year as chief resident in Internal Medicine. She has since practiced primary care for adults and children. She became very committed to caring for the transgender and gender-diverse community, and in 2016 founded the UCLA Gender Health Program. In her free time, Dr. Weimer enjoys reading, puzzles, spending time with her family and being active outdoors. Dr. Harrison Lee is a best in class bi-coastal plastic surgeon with pre-eminent plastic surgery practices in Beverly Hills (Los Angeles, CA), and NYC (Manhattan, New York). The triple board certified plastic surgeon focuses on quality advanced facial cosmetic plastic surgery. With this in mind, Dr. Harrison Lee accentuates pre-operative education, intra-operative technique, and post-operative comfort. Essential to this idea is the treatment of the patient as an individual, tailoring care to the patient’s specific needs. I still need more financial help to finally realize my lifelong dream of feminizing my body especially due to how hard life became for me a few months after being here battling housing instability, lack of traction, attacks from others including transgender people online, being illegally detained by LAPD, being targeted by my family members, and attacks by several transphobic men. These instances of derailed already extremely slow progress with this crowdfund.  Please support me in this journey to reaffirming my identity and finally being comfortable in my own skin. Your support matters because transgender people are often the targets of violent hate crimes and discrimination in society which makes it harder to find stability, work, or safe living conditions. Many organizations that claim to be there for LGBTQ+ do the bare minimum to actually help the community. Your direct action helps to support transgender leaders braving an ever-changing world landscape. You can also help spread word of my campaign by sharing the link with others and supporting my online art store. ",12223,245000,15-Sep-21

I am setting up this GoFundMe for my three-year-old nephew, Dawson Ough and his family, Jeff and Marissa (parents), 2 sisters and 2 brothers. Dawson was in horrific car accident on 10/21/21. He was flown to Harbor View Trauma Center and is still currently there. Dawson had severe head trauma and his pelvis was broken in 7 places. He underwent surgery on 10/22/21 and had 2 pins placed in his pelvis. He will be unable to walk for 3 months and will require 2 people to care for him at all times. In addition to that, his brain injury is still largely unknown. His team of doctors is thinking he will likely need upwards of a year of therapy. Once Dawson is stable enough to begin therapy he will be transferred to Seattle Children's Hospital for rehabilitation. This is where you all come in.... Jeff and Marissa are hard-working people who would give anything to anybody. But this time, they need our help. Dawson's medical insurance should pay for most of his medical and therapy needs, however the biggest barrier they will face is lost wages. On top of that they will be incurring a great deal of travel expenses to go back and forth from their home in Harrah, WA to Seattle, WA for appointments and therapies at least every two weeks after he is released from the hospital. They will also have to make some modifications to their home for Dawson when he is ready to come home. If you are able to donate anything, it is greatly appreciated. If not, if you could pass this on so that we can get the word out there, that would be amazing. Finally, if you could keep Dawson and his family in your thoughts and prayers, we would be forever grateful. I will keep this updated as much as possible. Thanks Again - Crystal ",3555,15000,3 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/jodis-liver-transplant-recovery-fund,Jodi's Liver Transplant Recovery Fund," TL; DR: After almost a year of being critically ill and unable to work, our amazing friend Jodi Kozenko Rentz is receiving a live donor liver transplant on Oct. 28th, 2021. Please contribute anything you can to help her out while she recovers from transplant surgery and sees her daughter Anna through the rest of senior year and plans for Anna's college! ❤️❤️ Please SHARE and encourage EVERYONE you know to take a few minutes to meet our Jodi! SCROLL THE WHOLE WAY DOWN for lots of photos! My name is Ellen Lettrich and I met Jodi Rentz in the spring of 1993, when we were Ellen Moran and Jodi Kozenko and both auditioning for the summer season at Apple Hill Playhouse in Delmont, PA, outside of Pittsburgh. Jodi was in college at Carlow, an incredibly smart, hilarious, fun-loving, talented, LOUD young woman. :) After losing touch in the pre-social media age, we reconnected in the spring of 2020 as I was thinking of moving out of NYC to VA - and we both decided it would be a fabulous idea for me to move into Jodi's apartment complex. And it was! We had a blast in the summer of 2020, and then Jodi's health took a terrible turn. She had a constellation of severe symptoms: extreme leg pain and swelling, waking up with blood in her mouth, coughing up blood, and extreme fatigue. From March 7 to June 18th, 2021, Jodi endured 3 separate emergency hospitalizations, with 21 days total in the ICU, sedated and ventilated (NOT Covid-related at all), and 30 days in step-down units - 51 total days in the hospital! My vibrant, 48 year old friend was emaciated almost beyond recognition, with jaundiced eyes and skin, and barely able to walk. From her first hospital admission in March, it was clear that she was in end-stage liver failure and would need a liver transplant. During her 3 hospitalizations, she endured more than 60 (!!!) surgical procedures in the OR, to tie off gastric bleeds and to release the arterial blood that had built up in her right leg. She received 57 (!!!) blood transfusions over the course of her hospitalizations. The severity of Jodi's condition during her 3rd hospitalization in June 2021 cannot be overstated. She was home with her incredible 17 year old daughter, Anna, when she began to feel really ill. To make a very long and graphic story short, I took Anna to work and at her request went to check on Jodi, whom I found passed out in a pool of blood in her bathroom, with blood everywhere. If you know Jodi at all, you know she is maaaaaybe a little stubborn :), and also a medical expert (truly). She argued with me about calling 911, but after she vomited blood twice more, I told her I didn't care what she said and I was calling 911. By then she was moving into shock; she remembers none of this. When Jodi arrived in the ER, her prognosis was dire. Later that night, despite successfully inserting a potentially life-saving stent through her jugular vein in what is called a TIPS procedure, Jodi's incredible medical team at Bon Secours St. Francis Hospital couldn't stop her internal bleeding. At that point, it was nearly certain she would not live through the night, and she was given last rites. But Jodi's higher power WANTS HER HERE!!! Through the love and dedication of her sister Lisa and daughter Anna, her family of friends, her AA tribe, her incredible medical team, and her LIVE liver donor, Tiffany Kidd Wormuth, Jodi is getting a new partial liver at UVA Hospital! Oct, 28, 2021, is LIVER LIFTOFF!! Jodi has worked her butt off to do EVERYTHING her doctors recommended, successfully upping her far-too-low BMI by cooking and eating ONLY what she has been instructed to eat (aided by an amazing meal train providing delicious low-sodium options for ANYTHING). As you can see from some of the photos here, almost all of which were taken this summer, she went from looking incredibly sick to being the healthiest-looking critically ill person you may have ever seen. Her liver is not functioning at all, but she has worked herself back into great health otherwise - so her transplant prognosis is EXCELLENT! ANYTHING you can contribute to help Jodi and Anna out until she is fully back on her feet and able to work is so appreciated. My wish is for those of you who haven't met Jodi - and there are SO MANY of you out there praying for her - is to be able to meet her at a big ""JODI HAS A GREAT LIVER"" party - if you know Jodi and me, this will OBVIOUSLY BE AT OUR POOL :) - next summer. She owned her destructive decisions and faced her alcoholism head on well before her liver decided it was done, and she has SO MUCH to offer the world. She has continued to be an amazing mom, dog & cat mom, dog aunty/bff (to my dog), sister, daughter, and friend despite sometimes barely being able to move. She is SO ready to get back to optometry, back to theatre, back to seeing her 86 year old dad in Latrobe, back to planning her purposely belated 30th high school reunion, & back to watching Anna continue to grow. To quote Ragtime, we can never go back to before - and that isn't at all what Jodi has planned. All the best parts of our Jodi remain intact, and you KNOW she'll be out making new friends everywhere, buying her people thoughtful gifts just because, and cracking us all up on a regular basis as soon as she can. We love you, Jodi! ",6615,10000,7 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-heal-mariel,Please Help Heal Mariel,"Team fundraiserJose Victor Corsiga and 4 others are organizing this fundraiser. MEET MY COUSIN MARIEL Let me introduce you to our dear Mariel Carla Q. de Jesus. She is beloved by many, not only her family. She is a project manager for a sustainability communications NGO in the Philippines. Her other full-time role is as a soprano for the chorale group, Hangad. She is a writer, a vegan, a yoga practitioner and an animal lover. She loves music, dancing, drawing, and is also a ""K-drama Tita"". Her singing has helped many people with their prayer life, and spiritual connection. But, she also loves singing standards, including K-pop. MARIEL'S CANCER JOURNEY In May of 2019, when she was 43, she was unexpectedly diagnosed with an extremely rare form of Ewing sarcoma, a bone cancer that is by nature aggressive, and more often afflicts adolescents. Apart from that tumor, which was found during a routine annual lung test for tuberculosis required by her office, she experienced no other signs or symptoms. At first, they thought it was lung cancer, but after a few more tests, it was found to be Ewing sarcoma. By the time the diagnosis was confirmed, she was already scheduled for surgery to remove the tumor in August, and that surgery was a success. However, due to Ewing sarcoma's systemic nature, the doctors mandated 16 sessions of chemotherapy and 20 sessions of radiation treatment. With the help and care of her sister, Lara, Mariel underwent this over a period of one year. Every 21 days, she received chemotherapy sessions as alternating one-day-long chemo sessions, and eight-day-long chemo sessions. This required hospitalization, sometimes up to two weeks due to complications. With God's grace and loving protection, Mariel made that arduous journey through the Covid pandemic lockdown in Manila, one of the top 10 worst places to be during the pandemic. She completed the chemo treatment, was given one month rest, and then she proceeded with daily sessions of radiation. The treatment which ended right before Christmas of 2020, was a success. Her subsequent scans were clear, and her hair soon grew back in lush curls. We were overjoyed and filled with gratitude. She was able to return to her life of singing, and dancing, and drawing—she had never stopped working from home, even through the chemotherapy sessions. NEW DEVELOPMENT In mid-September this year, Mariel noticed that she was getting short of breath. She had severe headaches, skin rashes and intermittent fevers. She was pale. Her doctors requested blood tests, and found that her cell counts were below normal. She was confined once again for red blood cells, and platelets transfusions. She also underwent a bone marrow biopsy to diagnose her condition. With hospital blood banks dry due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to call out for kind compatible blood donors, willing to come to the hospital during the pandemic. It was a huge ask, but, many kind souls responded. Mariel received the transfusions she needed. We prayed that the bone marrow biopsy would reveal that it was simply suppressed by her past chemo, and could be re-stimulated. However, the biopsy results were not what we prayed and hoped for. On October 11, 2021, her 45th birthday, Mariel was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), in all likelihood, as a secondary cancer due to her earlier treatment. TREATMENT PLAN ""Acute"" in AML means that the leukemia is fast-moving and aggressive. However, it is treatable. Mariel needs even more intense chemotherapy, more blood and platelets transfusions over an as yet unknown period of time. It is projected that she will require confinement for two to four months, so that the doctors can manage infections, and other complications that may arise from treatment. Ultimately, she will need a bone marrow transplant. FINANCES There is much that she needs—blood and platelet donors, a bone marrow donor, excellent medical management and nursing care, prayers, and of course, financial support. Mariel's Philippine health insurance has been depleted, and she has no more coverage. The family funds are likewise running low. This second cancer involves one of the most expensive medical procedures out there. We are asking for help in all respects, but in this particularly, recognizing that a little bit from a lot of people can go a long long way towards covering her immense medical expenses. Her sisters, concerned cousins, and friends have started this crowdfunding page to raise (even at least in part) the sum that will help cover Mariel's medical costs and make it easier for kind, generous hearts to contribute. We cannot be more grateful for even the smallest amounts donated, and we, as well as Mariel, will be in your debt. It is not an easy thing to ask, but we humbly dare to ask it. Mariel is young, strong and faithful. She knows the journey ahead will be even more challenging, but she is ready for it, and truly thankful for any financial help given. With all our heart, we thank you for reading and thank you in advance for your kind donation. ",59605,75000,12-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-nick-continue-his-fight-with-cancer,Help nick continue his fight with cancer," As some of you may know I was diagnosed with stage Iv rectal cancer back in 2018 and was given only a couple months to live and through the Grace  of GOD, surgery, dietary changes, multiple rounds of chemo and some small doses of radiation I am still here today. I haven’t had to have any treatments for the past 10 months, towards the end of those ten months I developed a dry cough that was persistent and alarming. I got multiple covid tests which were all negative, so I finally asked to get back to the oncologist to see if they could find anything. They found multiple little tumors that had shown up in my lungs, all very small in size. Some of the tumors have pressed up against some nerves which was forcing me to have that dry cough. That cough has persisted in intensity and today I was coughing so hard that I had a partial lung collapse. Boy oh boy that is a painful experience.  I’m currently being treated at United hospital which is a wonderful place. I’m making this go fund me because I’m so sick of this cancer stuff dragging on. I want to use this money to get to a facility that specializes in alternative cancer treatments which have been proven to cure cancer many times. It’s not the conventional western medicine clinic but I believe it is the right place for me to get me healthy. So I can return to my family and provide for them like a father and man should.

She has been fighting against cancer for years and it advanced in her brain really suddenly in the last 4 months without her knowing. Last week she was in the hospital all week with horrible migraines and this last weekend she was told that she needed to prepare for leaving, they said it could be months or that it could be tomorrow. This last week she was home taken care of and loved by Jorge, her mother and close friends. Yesterday afternoon she passed peacefully in the hospital with Jorge and Karunesvari by her side who with the help of a devotee nurse covered her in auspiscuous articles ( Tilak , Vrindavan dust, Tulasi, Nrsimha Kavaca and oil , Srimatis lotus feet at head while listening to kirtan. She had two mystical experiences that she shared: She saw a picture of Archangel Micheal in vision and he gave her a message that he was there with her and that she should go home and so she left as soon as she could to spend the last week with her family and friends which was crucial in this transition . This vision and message came to her at the same time that her friend was praying to this angel for her protection. The 2nd that she shared was that the picture of Srimati Radharani that was by her bed side was glowing for her at some point and giving her strength and comfort . She is a very special soul who became a devotee at 14 and sold her mom the Bhagavad Gita and inspired , her sister and brother to all become devotees. She did sankirtan and served her guru maharaja.

Last week when I asked her which form she felt most connected to she said Balaram was her first Guru, she found a picture of Him and right away began sobbing. and she said she also felt very connected to Srimati Radharani.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jolene-hear,Hearing Aids for Jolene," With a heavy and desperate heart we are asking for help for our daughter Jolene.  Jolene is 18 years old and has been struggling with Chronic illness for the last 12 years of her life. Due to her illness, Jolene has not been able to live a normal childhood. Instead of spending time hanging with friends, having sleepovers, and having no worries in the world, she spends her time going back and forth to many specialists searching for answers. The past two years Jolene’s health has taken a turn for the worse, which include bouts of parallelization, organs shutting down and many other symptoms.  After many years of dealing with the unknown we have finally reached a point of some concrete diagnosis. Jolene has been diagnosed with POTS, Dysautonomia, Non Radio Graphic Ankylosing Spondylitis, a neurogenic bladder and Lupus. These are autoimmune diseases that attack many different parts of her body, including organs. We currently see a large team of specialists from all over NYS and Boston Children’s Hospital.  Jolene’s symptoms through the years have gotten much worse and changed with her age. Our biggest issue right now, which we are asking for help with, is her hearing loss. We are hoping to raise enough money to support her in receiving hearing aids.  Jolene has neurogenic hearing loss issues that cause a breakdown in her processing center. This creates not only hearing loss but a loss in understanding in what she hears. Our health insurance is Tricare EAST, which is a type of military health insurance that does not cover hearing aids. We have appealed this decision twice, and have involved her team of doctors, but they are still declining any and all coverage.  As her hearing loss/processing issues are not cut and dry hearing loss we have to make sure we use a knowledgeable audiologist. At this point in time Jolene has seen three different audiologists getting the same results…that she needs hearing aids to assist her in her day to day routine. Jolene was lucky enough to borrow a pair of hearing aids from one of the audiologist, however it was only for a short period of time. Jolene struggles to hear the most basic sounds and conversations without these hearing aids.  The hearing aids that will provide Jolene with the best help and that are the most cost effective for out of pocket purchasing are $6,000. It saddens us, but we cannot afford the best for our little girl. We have tried multiple agencies and sadly they decline helping us.  Through the years we have spent a small fortune on out of pocket medical costs including copays, medicine, non-covered therapies and doctor appointments and we will continue to do so to help our little girl.  As I am self-employed and her main caregiver I am often losing work due to doctor appointments and emergency hospitalizations for her health. This has caused a huge strain on our finances through the years. We are asking just for help with her hearing aids. Jolene has been fitted and the hearing aids are ready to be ordered, but at this time we cannot afford them on our own.  We are asking for your help, even the smallest amount will help her to be able to hear and process information. We can no longer see our baby girl struggle and not be able to understand her teachers, family and friends.  Jolene’s health has taken so much from her already, please help us not let it take her hearing too!  ",3285,6000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/laura-smith-medical-expenses,Laura Smith Medical Expenses," Laura has been a friend and champion in our community for 20+ years. She never misses an opportunity to come alongside a student, a woman, a family, or member of the community who needs help. Now Laura needs our help and support. What started out as a kidney stone rapidly spiraled into a life or death situation. The stone blocked the function of her kidneys and left her body shutting down and fighting to stay alive. Due to sepsis, Laura is experiencing long term side effects from the poisons that ravaged her body. She has now been in ICU and a critical care unit since October 9th. Her current diagnosis is kidney failure with additional complications including  lack of circulation, severely diminished eyesight, muscle atrophy, low blood pressure and a multitude of other concerns.  These issues will not remedy themselves overnight, once Laura is released from the hospital she will need long term care (first in a facility and later at home).   While the family does have health insurance we know that her medical expenses will far exceed what insurance covers. In addition, the Smith family is now without Laura’s income and her help in transportation for the kids (to/from school & activities), daily housekeeping, and more (she really is irreplaceable)! Hiring someone to help with these routine tasks may be needed as Laura recovers. After already spending 16 days in the hospital, needing the care and attention of many specialized doctors and medical tests, the cost of her care is climbing rapidly.  Our hope in starting this fund is that the family could concentrate on Laura’s health and healing without the added worry of finances.   If Laura Smith has made an impact on you or your family’s lives would you come alongside the Smith family today and support Laura’s recovery with a financial gift? To meet our goal we need just 50 people to give $100 and 40 people to give $50.  Of course, gifts of any amount are welcome.  Let’s stand together for Laura and her family by giving generously.  There are 2 ways you can give: Go Fund Me- Give through this  safe & secure go fund me page iQ Credit Union- Local Clark County friends & family can donate directly to the Laura Smith Donation Fund (Account #705516) at any  iQ Credit Union location.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/phriends-of-mike-rafferty,Let's Fight for Mike!  We need your help.,"Team fundraiserBill DeWitt and 0 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Lindsay Rafferty. Hello friends, On September 6, 2020, our dear friend, Michael Rafferty, suffered a hemorrhagic stroke.   He has undergone three brain surgeries in the past year and feels lucky to be alive.  This traumatic event left the entire right side of Michael's body paralyzed. The massive stroke also left Micheal with the heartbreaking condition of Aphasia. Aphasia is the loss of the ability to understand or express speech caused by brain damage. As everyone knows, Michael was always known for his quick wit and ability to turn a phrase. Unfortunately, Aphasia has robbed this from him and has been devastating for him and his loved ones. Imagine not being able to understand what your loved ones are saying. Or, when you do understand, you cannot respond because you are unable to find the words. This is what Mike and his family are dealing with every day. Insurance has stopped paying for both Mike's physical and speech therapy. All therapy is now paid for by Mike and his wife Lindsay using the money they receive from disability, which is 40% of Mike's usual paycheck. We are hoping to raise money to get Mike the therapy and treatment he so desperately needs. Mike is working hard daily to regain his speech, but the progress has been slow. All the money raised will go to help Mike with his fight to regain some normalcy in life. We are asking for your help. Unfortunately, Michael is no longer able to enjoy many of the things he loves most in life. As many of you know, one of Mike's passions was music. He loved to play guitar and used his talents in his classroom to help teach his students through song. His creativity and love of music were contagious, and he used his gifts to inspire and connect with his students. With physical therapy, we hope Mike can regain the use of his right hand to allow him to create music again. Michael's wife, Lindsay, has been with Mike every step of the way, making sure Mike gets the best treatment and care possible. But, unfortunately, they are exhausting their savings and need our help to get Mike the care he deserves. Mike and Lindsay have two children that have also been affected by the circumstances of the past year. His youngest, Mya, is now a freshman in college and has a challenging time being away from her dad during this time. His eldest, Jake, is a junior in college and cannot help his mom as much as he did this past summer. Lindsay is being strong, but she needs our support. We are asking for your help. Please help us give Mike a chance to regain some normalcy in life. We hope that with both physical and speech therapy, Mike can regain some control of his life. But, unfortunately, these therapies are not covered by insurance, so we need to provide financial assistance for Mike and his family. Thank you in advance for all your love and support. Together we can make a difference for our dear friend Mike. If you have any questions or want to learn more about how you can help, please reach out. Let's give Mike the same love and support he has given each of us over the years. Let's flood him with overwhelming support, so he and Lindsay know that they are not alone. Please share this link with all your friends and family so they can help us in this fight. Go Team Mike Rafferty and Phriends! ",34587,40000,18-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/evans-open-heart-surgery-fund,Evan’s Open Heart Surgery Fund ❤️‍," Dear Friends, I would like to start off by stating that this is very hard for us to have to post and the following may come as a shock to you. What you’re about to read is extremely personal and sensitive to us. It hurts having to post this but we’ve exhausted all other options and resources.  As some of you may know, Evan has lived with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) all of his life. Evan’s heart has now doubled in size to the point of being life threatening. When he engages in activities (including eating a simple meal), it “blows up like a balloon” [that’s the best way of describing it]. This phenomenon creates a serious health risk, discomfort, and a significant amount of pressure on his heart and chest. This stimulates other symptoms to follow, such as: shortness of breath, dizziness, feeling of total body weakness, palpitations, chest pain and fatigue. This is something Ev has had to live with for all of his life and does not like people even knowing about it. He has never let this condition control his life and won’t allow it to be the foundation of his future.  With that being said, I ask for your sincere consideration and I want you all to know how hard it is to have to ask for help with this matter. We don’t like to ask for help but it has come to the point where we do, indeed, need help. We do have health insurance but, there are other unsurmountable hidden expenses that are not covered. At this point, our insurance is giving us unexpected problems and we are very concerned it won’t be covered. BUT we are out of choices and have to proceed with the surgery. I’m asking for a donation of whatever you are able to help with. Whether it’s monetary value - to help pay for the medical bills, care packages - for his very long & tiresome recovery, or even just a card ❤️‍.  He will not be able to work or do much for several months after this life saving surgery. We love and appreciate your help and concerns during these troubling times. Thank you so much for being in our lives and supporting us.  We are staying super positive & strong. We WILL get through this ❤️  Sincerely, Evan & Shelby ",13738,50000,4 days

This is Christopher Drake. He has Janz Syndrome, also known as Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy. This genetic disorder manifested itself a few days after he turned 16 years old. I won’t bore you with all the details, but dealing with this lifelong disease has been very challenging for him. For the most part, his seizures are controlled with medication, but there are risk factors for every epileptic (sleep deprivation, stress, missing medication, etc). Last Friday he had a vet appointment to put his dog to sleep due to bone cancer. The dog was keeping him up at night, and he was stressed and sad about putting him down. Consequently, he had a grand mal seizure in the grocery store that day and was sent to the hospital. He’s at home now and slowly recovering.  Depression and anxiety have set in, which is normal but difficult. Also, he will lose the ability to drive until he is medically cleared. This will take several months. This GoFundMe is to raise funds for him to get an Uber ride when he needs one. We are also looking into other services and options, but it is a process. It takes time to qualify and they will not always be available. My husband and I can help with his medical bills, but I am asking for small donations from friends and family in order to get him a large Uber gift card that will last him for six months. Mostly, I'd like to let him know that he is loved and supported during this difficult time. Thanks in advance.   ",4755,3000,3 days

Pete will be starting treatment and having surgery in a few weeks. Unfortunately this isn't the first time that Peter has fought cancer in his lifetime. As a young boy, he battled bone cancer and had his leg amputated at 11 years of age. While we hope that he can successfully fight this evil disease one more time, we are also facing the fact that this will be a very difficult journey. Since receiving his diagnosis, my brother has been unable to work which means that he has no income to cover his day-to-day expenses during this time, not to mention the added medical expenses that are piling up. Peter lives alone with his cat and dog after having separated from his wife. His children are also grown with families of their own to support. After receiving the more detailed test results just a few weeks ago, it's looking more and more like Peter will not be returning to work - or at least not any time in the near future. I am usually on the other side of this and not one to ask for help, but my brother needs it so desperately right now. He has applied for disability, which could take months to years to reach any resolution. He's also actively reaching out for assistance of any kind, but has been striking out at every turn. Peter needs help now, especially with winter and cold weather coming soon. We are asking for $30,000 as our best guess to cover one year's of expenses plus at least a portion of the medical bills. Anything that you could provide would be greatly appreciated by my family and most importantly, by my brother. ",3985,30000,7 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-justin-keep-fighting-jmostrong,Help Justin keep fighting #JMOStrong," In June of 2021, Justin was diagnosed with T cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  He immediately began treatment and has been fighting like a warrior ever since.  Justin is a beloved father to his three beautiful, energetic young boys, and a loving husband to his amazing wife, Cassie.   The news has been immensely traumatic and Justin has demonstrated tremendous strength and positivity throughout this experience.   Justin is continuing his treatments, fighting to regain his health and is not yet able to return to work.    Anyone who knows Justin,  knows what a positive light he shines on this world.  The Montello family is so appreciative for everyone that has been a part of this journey. The funds needed were calculated based on missing pay and medical coverage to get this family through the time that Justin will be missing work.  Please see the family's story below:There was no time to process an unexpected diagnosis of cancer when I was just 32 years old. I was sent directly to the ER by a family doctor after being on antibiotics for three weeks for an infected tooth. Three weeks before the diagnosis, I had gone to the dentist to find out that I had an infected tooth and needed a root canal. The dentist claimed my tooth infection was the reason for little lymph nodes noticeably popping up behind my ears and eventually down around my neck. Although the first round of antibiotics did not work, the dentist was sure that another round would. However, another round of antibiotics didn’t work and I got much worse in a matter of two weeks. I began to tire very easily and I developed a dry cough with a shortness of breathe. When I got to the family doctor, she took one look at my physical state and the nods behind my ears and sent me to the ER right away. My wife was able to meet me at the ER for what we thought would just be a long day getting fluids and maybe finding out that I had pneumonia. Within the first two hours there, I was feeling good with some fluids and having a seemingly normal conversation with my wife when the test started to produce results that showed a more painful and complicated story. The doctor very casually came to tell my wife and me that they (the team of doctors) were confident that this was more serious and their suspect was lymphoma. It was so difficult for us to hear; we didn’t even fully understand what it meant. This news was followed by more extensive tests involving the bone marrow and a transfer to Cleveland Clinic main campus. There, it was actually confirmed to be T-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. This all happened within four days of getting the terrible news in the ER. It was already all over much of my body through lymph nodes, a softball size mediastinal mass on my chest and in over 90% of my bone marrow. It was very aggressive so an aggressive protocol, AYA, started immediately. This experience has been undeniably painful and difficult: physically, mentally and emotionally. We are not a family in pain; we are a family that can do hard things. We can look back on this support to show our kids that when we were up against adversity, we had undeniable love and unbreakable hope to get us through. We want our kids to remember that life is beautiful and when a diagnosis tried to define us, we did not let it. Instead, we redefined how we wanted to live and what was important to our family.Justin is in remission and after the aggressive treatments so far, no leukemia cells are detected within his body.  This is the most incredible news for Justin, his family and this community. That being said, the treatment for a diagnosis like this will continue for two and a half more years.  His family is looking forward to finishing #JMoStrong.  ",25225,25000,22-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/v8kmy-matthews-road-to-recovery,Matthew’s Road to Recovery," Update (10/27/21): We wanted to take a moment to update everyone on Matthew’s condition and progress, as well as THANK everyone for helping us meet our initial GoFundMe goal of $10,000. First, to everyone that is praying and keeping vigil for Matthew, we want you to know we feel the love … and, know your prayers are being heard. Although Matthew’s recovery has been slow the last two weeks, please know that God is hearing everyone’s prayers for Matthew. He is a very determined young man, and continues to make strides daily. Additionally, we wanted to share that Matthew’s days are filled with visits from the speech therapist to the occupational therapist to the physical therapist. It is non-stop care for Matthew, and after each session with a specialist he is often exhausted and drained. But, he’s determined! Please know the doctors and staff have all been amazing … so, please continue to pray for them since Matthew is under their care. Matthew’s doctor has updated us on his diagnosis and prognosis. They have confirmed that Matthew’s tumor is cancerous, and is identified as a Medulloblastoma. Almost every symptom that’s listed for this type of tumor were symptoms he was exhibiting; and, never in a million years would we think that disguising itself as cluster migraines would turn out to be this. Matthew’s doctors have shared his road to recovery is long! Once out of the hospital, a decision will be made as to when he’ll start chemotherapy. Our understanding is that he’ll do chemotherapy almost daily for six weeks, and then shift to doing weekly radiation treatments (that may last upwards of 9 months). As you can see the road is long, and will be filled with many ups and downs. Nevertheless, we are very HOPEFUL! And, with the grace of God, his prognosis is good! Since we now know what lies ahead, we have decided to raise the donation goal to help cover the medical costs we anticipate. We ask that you share this page and continue to keep Matthew in your prayers. Our goal is to provide weekly updates.  From the bottom of our hearts, THANK YOU! ",15314,25000,7 days

Please join us in supporting Ryan Jones, his wife Amanda, and sons Corbin (10) and Bennett (7) while he fights against stage 3 pancreatic cancer!A little back story... back in March 2021, Ryan had several mild symptoms that seemed to correlate to his history of diverticulitis.  After losing quite a bit of weight, he tried to get in with his doctor to get checked out.  Ryan felt really bad one weekend in particular and was able to get in with Dr. Jeffrey Warhaftig on Tuesday 8/24/21 who took labs and ordered abdominal ultrasound for the next day. Initially it was thought to be his gallbladder.  However, after the ultrasound was performed we received a call that a pancreatic mass was found.  A CT was performed later that day that confirmed the pancreatic mass, along with other concerning areas.  Dr. Warhaftig was able to get Ryan in the next day with GI doctor, Dr. Ramage who scheduled Ryan the next Monday for an ultrasound guided EDG (diagnostic procedure) where he did a biopsy of pancreas, liver, and celiac lymph node.  Once pathology results were in several days later, it was confirmed that Ryan had adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (the more aggressive type).   Dr. Ramage put in an oncology referral and Dr. Warhaftig was able to get Ryan in with the new GI oncologist (20yrs in military-Dr. Scofield)  here in Wilmington, NC and Ryan was his very first patient here!  At this time he has been diagnosed as stage 3.  His tumor is unfortunately non-surgical due to artery involvement.  His treatment is 3 chemo’s combined at once.  Every 2 weeks he goes in for roughly 6 hours of chemo treatment.  Then he brings home slow flow chemo on Tuesday-Thursday administered through his port using a pump .  Then on that Friday, he receives a Neulasta shot which is a bone marrow simulant which helps his body make more white blood cells. This chemo schedule is the most aggressive at this time for pancreatic cancer.  From that day of the shot and for the next week or so, the side effects are really tough to handle and Ryan often has to take time away from work.  He has had 3 cycles so far and he may have to have up to 12.  They are hopeful they will be able to operate after chemo. A combination of the bills starting to come in and extra time he is having to take off work because he is sick leads us to ask for help from friends, family, and business associates.  Also, Ryan does not have life insurance and will now be unable to obtain it due to his diagnosis.  Please help the Jones family if you can through these next 3+ months while he fights for his life!  Anything helps, there is no donation too small.  The Jones family is so appreciative of the love and support.  ",43085,100000,18-Oct-21

This is the seventh year that Chiefs of Police have waived their departments’ facial hair policies and will be allowing officers to grow beards through the month of November. We are proud to be joined by local Volunteer Firefighters, EMS and Dispatchers from Lancaster County, PA. Each year Officers select a first responder, an immediate family member of a first responder, or an organization from the community who is currently battling Cancer, or provides care to those battling cancer. This year the Beards for Brothers campaign will raise money for Kristopher Hurley, a member of the Lancaster County Special Emergency Response Team (S.E.R.T.) Kris Hurley is currently the Medic Team Leader/Training Coordinator for the Lancaster County Police S.E.R.T. Kris served his Country faithfully and honorably for 8 years in the United States Marine Corps, and continued that service as a military contractor. Kris has over 20 years of experience as both a tactical operator and instructor. He is recognized as a subject matter expert in the areas of high threat protection, tactical team movement (CQB), communications, explosives and explosive devices, counter terrorism operations, surveillance/counter surveillance, and a range of operational tradecraft. Kris continues to share his knowledge and experience with the Law Enforcement and Public Safety communities as an instructor through his various positions and his company, Direct Action Tactical. Kris has trained countless first responders to include; the Department of Defense, Special Operations Command, Local Police Bomb Squads, SWAT, and Fire Department Hazardous Device Units, and continues to do so. This summer Kris found a lump his neck. Kris sought treatment and found he has a fairly rare/aggressive cancer (SMARCB1 deficient carcinoma), that is affecting his tonsils and neck. Kris underwent surgery to remove the cancer, which was successful. However, Kris has a long road ahead of him. Kris will continue to undergo treatment to fight the cancer. It is our hope through the support of his wife of 21 years and two children, family, friends and those in the First Responder Community that we can help ease some of the burden associated with Kris’ battle with cancer. We will also be donating a percentage of the money raised to A Week Away (AWA). AWA is a non-profit organization that “coordinates and funds respite weeks for families who are battling a life-threatening illness, with the goal of providing them the hope they need to continue their fight”. As first responders, we swore to serve and protect our communities.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/supporting-katina-through-lymphoma,Supporting Katina through Lymphoma.," Hello, my name is Kathy Snider. Katina Snider is my sister in law. She is a wife to Carl, Mother to Bella, Tristan, Carly and Roman, a Grandma to Liam and Lily and a daughter to Connie. Katina is a kind and loving person, that has given much to many over the years. She has worked hard to climb the corporate ladder and was very successful. Then COVID-19 happened. When the world was forced to shut down, she and her family were placed in a situation where they had to live off of their savings for a long while. Just when things started to reopen, Katina had a stiff neck an inability to swallow. After a while she felt a lump in her throat. She went to a series of doctor appointments to find that she would be diagnosed with Stage 3 Primary Thyroid Lymphoma. She would soon learn that her cancer was extremely rare (less than 2% of all Lymphomas) and aggressive and she would have to fight for her life to beat the Lymphoma. Katina had surgery on June 23, 2021 . The doctors were able to remove a large 3.75 pound mass from her throat. Unfortunately they were not able to remove all of the cancer and a considerable portion of the mass has wrapped around her vocal chords causing her voice to be so faint, that her once strong voice is barely a whisper. The force she has to use to be make her voice heard is exhausting and painful. It causes her to be out of breath and gasp for air as she speaks. Her next surgery was on July 17th to place a port in her body for her upcoming Chemotherapy. Katina’s chemotherapy treatments are so aggressive that one of them is actually called The Red Devil. She receives a combination of Chemotherapy called the RCHOP. She had her first treatment on July 25th. While the doctors prepared her for how her body would respond, none of us expected the chemotherapy to make her as ill as it did. Katina has fought to be strong but unfortunately, these treatments have taken a toll. She lost her hair almost immediately, she is sick to her stomach, her skin hurts to touch, her whole body aches. At times she is delirious and in so much pain she wishes to sleep and not wake up. Katina has had to spend many days and nights in the hospital to get her levels up so that she, simply doesn’t die from her body reacting to chemotherapy. She has to receive treatments every 21 days until November, 2021. At this point, the doctors will be doing a PET scan to determine how her body has responded to the chemotherapy. Both Carl and Katina were off of work for 14 weeks without income when retail was shut down worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this point she has been off work since June 2021, with no idea of when she may be able to return to work. While Carl is able to work, and he is doing his very best to support his family, finances are extremely strained right now. Most people cannot survive almost a year off of their savings. Katina and Carl have been frugal and careful with every penny. At this point, they need help. Katina’s treatments are extremely expensive. Their sweet son Roman has type 1 diabetes also known as juvenile diabetes. His life depends upon his treatment and medication. Katina carries the insurance for her family and their out of pocket deductible is extremely high. When they were both working, they could afford Romans medications. Now that she isn’t working Carl’s income is not what they need it to be to cover bills, food, and medical expenses. They are running dangerously low on funds to survive. I can tell you that Katina is a very strong woman. Those of you that know her, I am sure you would agree. Through this entire experience, she hasn’t wanted to ask for help. Doing so has been very hard for her. She has taken great pride in how she has worked hard for her success, starting as a hairdresser for Regis Corporation , to climbing a corporate ladder to become a District Field Manager for Sephora. Even now, when she almost has nothing, she is working on a non profit to eventually help women diagnosed with cancer. She is calling it the Mermaid Guild. On days she has the strength, she spends time researching how to help others. She says that maybe this entire experience was what was needed to help her help others. I think that speaks to her heart. She tells me often, to hold your loved ones close, to not hold hatred in your heart and to love with all of your heart, because we don’t know the future. We aren’t promised tomorrow. I pray that Katina has many tomorrow’s left. I pray that her scans next month deliver a good report. Her family needs her, we all need her. If you are able, please consider giving to Katina and Carl. They are are in a place of need. If you are unable to give financially, that is ok, prayer is free and God knows they can all use as many prayers as possible. I have attached photos of Katina before cancer and after. I also attached photos of the mass removed and the scan of the mass while still in her throat. There is a short video Katina made when she still had strength for her non profit she hopes to someday get off the ground. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to ask. Thank you all, and please hold your loved ones a bit tighter and don’t take time for granted. Life is but a blink of the eye. ",6640,25000,3 days

He went to the ER on September 19th, 2021 with pain in his abdomen, and blood in his stool. He is currently at the Methodist Hospital in St. Louis Park undergoing various tests, and is receiving the first phase of chemo. His vitals keep bouncing around and the doctors need to get that under control before he can be discharged. He will continue his treatment in the comfort of his home, with his family. Chris is a loving father, son, and brother to a very tight-knit family. His wife Maya, kids: Nicholas, Gavin, Neel, and Nathan, along with his parents, Greg and Barb; siblings Jeff, Lindsay, Kelley, Ryan, Mike and Steph are looking for help funding his hospital bills (and a little morale boost.) Not everyone has had to deal with cancer, but everyone knows cancer sucks. Truck is only 47. Chris is and always has been a pretty reserved dude. Sure, he’ll hangout with his close friends and family and make us laugh with his subtle humor, but he would rather chill at home and binge Netflix, or build Legos with his kids. He is a very hard worker as well. Lives a normal, quiet life in the 'burbs. He's pretty much the poster child of the term “salt of the earth kinda fella”. It pains me to have to do this on his behalf, but it has to be done. It’s not over. He’s not leaving. This is a long time listener, first time caller sort of thing. Hospitals are a Godsend, but not cheap. His prognosis is grim, but not a throw in the towel. Chris is unable to work at this time and bills are starting to come in and he needs help. Financial stress is the last thing he and Maya need to worry about right now. It’s not only the donations that will help tremendously, it’s also a great way to help him stay positive by seeing the support in his journey. Half of this battle is positive thinking. Where does his nickname Truck come from? When our mom was pregnant with Chris, Truckin' by the Grateful Dead was playing on the radio, and she told our dad ""we have a trucker inside"". Ironically, he was a truck driver for many years. Thank you in advance for supporting Truck in his journey with cancer. #keepontruckin' ",26615,50000,13-Oct-21

A car pulled in front of him causing him to swerve and roll the truck. Ayden was thrown from the vehicle but his friend, Justin, was pinned in the truck as it rested upside down and burst into flames. Ayden rushed to the truck and pulled his friend out. Justin was found to be uninjured and was reunited with his parents.  Ayden was severely burned and was rushed to the hospital. Ayden sustained 2nd and 3rd degree burns to 70 percent of his body; primarily his head, neck, and upper body. He remains unconsciously sedated as the surgeries begin. Ayden just recovered from a severe broken leg caused by a dirt bike crash in June. His strength of character and perseverance lead him through what would be challenging for anyone, but especially for someone with such a passion for active life. This injury was a temporary deterrent to his interests of finishing high school, restoring his beloved truck, and attending lineman school for the start of a career (not necessarily in Ayden’s order of perceived significance). Ayden benefits from a thriving environment provided by his mother, young sisters, stepdad, and loving grandparents, even in the loss of his father in an accident when Ayden was an infant. We (Ayden’s extended family) love him, of course, as family would, but actually enjoy him too. We seek a means by which this horrific story can, in some way, console Ayden’s heart and spirit. We wish to convey to Ayden that his sacrifice for his friend is acknowledged by God and his community. His goals should be achieved regardless of this tragedy. Ayden’s ability to earn money is affected at this point so we ask for help with school tuition and a replacement mode of transportation.

At current Ben is currently in a battle to save his life as he has been diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer.  Our family has been rocked to it's core as we try to find the best approach to support Ben in his battle with such an aggressive cancer. We recently celebrated his 40th birthday on September 4th and now we are having to deal with such devastating news. His life was forever changed on October 1st, 2021 when he was informed of his pancreatic cancer diagnosis. It must have been the shock of such news that caused him to have an embolic stroke that same day which required hospitalization. My sister Lulu (his wife) has been at his bedside since, and  unfortunately due to covid she has been at it alone. The hospital has a really strict policy on who is allowed to visit him, especially since being in and out of ICU. Your kind donations will continue to allow Lulu to be his number one medical advocate. She has committed herself to being at his bedside and seeing him through all of this, she is a warrior that won't give up so easy.

Her health has been declining for months, and it is no longer safe for her to live on her own. Ashley has been staying with Mama 24/7 since the diagnosis, and I relieve her when I can.  Mama’s condition is not improving, and it is becoming more difficult for us to care for her without additional support. Mama’s one request is to stay in her home as long as possible, and we want to make that happen for her. In order to do that, we need to be able to hire caregivers, purchase medical equipment not covered by insurance, and provide other items or services needed to make Mama as comfortable and safe as possible in her home. Ashley and I are going through a lot, and we are not equipped to handle what’s ahead without assistance. We would be very grateful for any support you can give.

Jeff wasn't feeling well on Sunday and went to the hospital. He had a heart attack and will be in the hospital for a little while. We are incredibly thankful Jeff went to the hospital when he did. The report from the doctor is that there are multiple and significant blockages so he will need a quadruple bypass surgery. We are waiting to hear more details. Anyone who knows Jeff and Lindsey knows they live their lives in service to others. Their love for Jesus is reflected in the way they serve, not just their family and friends, but to anyone who crosses their path . If there is a need they know about, they are the first to show up and give. I have so many memories of how they have helped me personally in the hardest seasons of my life. I've watched them buy groceries for others countless times, lend their car to friends, fix and repair homes, and countless other gifts they have given over the years. The biggest gift they give is love and a safe place to land. Jeff and Lindsey need our prayers right now and they also need our help. We believe Jeff is going to be healed and fully recovered in Jesus name. We believe he is going to be more healthy and have more energy than ever before. Right now the doctor's report is that Jeff will need to have at least 3 months time to recover from open heart surgery. Jeff is a private contractor and the sole financial resource for their family of 6. During Jeff's recovery time, they will not have a steady income. Not only that, there are going to be medical bills that need to be paid. Our prayer is that all their needs are met, above and beyond. We are rallying and coming alongside the Elston family to help and support them during this hard season. We are believing that the financial pressure is completely removed so they can focus on their family and Jeff healing. We are asking everyone to get involved in some way. Pray, give and SHARE! A little bit from a lot of people is all it takes. Share a story about how Jeff and Lindsey have helped you and share this gofund me page with others. Thank you!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-for-the-family-of-amanda-perry,Help for the Family of Amanda Perry,"Elizabeth Ratliff is organizing this fundraiser. On Wednesday, September 15th, at 36 years old, Amanda Rose Perry was admitted to the Horizon Medical Center Emergency room with Covid complications where she was diagnosed with a severe case of Covid pneumonia. At the time, she was 32 weeks pregnant, and an emergency c-section was performed. Since that day in mid-September, Amanda was ventilated, and soon airlifted, to Virginia for more supports. Billy, her sweet husband, drove to Richmond and secured an apartment to be by her side through it all. He never missed a day with her. Amanda had her better days and her challenging days. From responsive hand squeezes, blinks and attempts to smile or mouth ""I love you"", she fought until the very end.  She fought through high fevers, mastitis, a tracheotomy, bacteria in her blood, a collapsed lung, and a blood transfusion, ALL while healing from a cesarean, before finally making her way to heaven on October 18th. After a month in the NICU, baby Nolan was recently released to Amanda's mother and is doing well. He is currently at home with his grandmother, Carlene, and his two older brothers.  To know Amanda was to love her. Her smile was contagious. Her warmth and kindness were felt by all who crossed her path. She truly had the sweetest soul and most tender heart. The love she had for her children and being their momma was boundless and evident in everything she did. She loved nothing more than being a mother to her boys and a wife to her husband. Amanda and Billy prayed for years for another baby, and she was over the moon when she became pregnant with baby Nolan. Her unwavering love of Billy and their family was unmatched. Her family and friends hoped prayed day in and day out that Billy would be able to bring his best friend home, healthy and ready to raise their new baby together. Unfortunately, God had different plans for this family.  Her husband, mother, and children now need the rest of us, who have been showering them with prayer, to show up in a big way. The last thing this family needs to stress about is the crippling medical debt that is sure to come. Amanda had the most generous heart, and we know she would appreciate your help in her family's greatest time of need. Please find it in your hearts to give what you can. Every amount adds up. Please hug your loved ones and share this with your communities.We sure will miss our girl. Elizabeth Ratliff & Taylor Luther ",45212,50000,18-Oct-21

It is especially difficult as just a few months ago cancer had befallen her father, forcing him to max out his paid leave as he struggled to recover.

He has a rare kidney syndrome called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) cause is still unknown at this time (though this is most common a bad gut bacteria). Due to the sudden kidney failure he was sedated and put on a ventilator to receive continuous dialysis. His numbers are improving on 10-25-21 and trending in the right direction. They are trying to get him in to surgery to place a PD catheter today (10-26) that would allow him to come off the vent, and remove the dialysis port in his neck. The PD catheter is surgically placed in his abdominal wall and this allows him to get dialysis through there. While he won’t be on a vent, he will still need to be sedated as to not pull on all his cords etc, but should be more aware than now. The Doctors have explained it can be a painful process for his little body to start with until we get all the right pain and sedation medication dialed in for him. We will keep updating as things actually happen, we don’t want to get too far ahead of ourselves... this is one day at a time and it can take a week, a few weeks or possibly months for kidney function to be back to normal (or the new normal) We appreciate all the support and prayers!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-louie-frausto-medical-expenses,Help louie frausto medical expenses," My nephew Louie is 20 years old and attending Dixie State University where he is pursuing the surgical technician program. He’s always seen as a happy and caregiving son and big brother to 4 siblings. On Sunday October 10th, Louie began to feel ill. It started as a regular sore throat and fever, but eight days later he was fighting for his life. Louie’s original infection remains a mystery. The infection triggered an autoimmune response that has triggered a lesion on his brain and infected his brain stem. He has since been diagnosed with Bickerstaff Encephalitis; a very rare post-infectious neurological disease. His first two days in the hospital did not go well as he was rushed to the Intensive Care Unit due to a failed feeding tube procedure. He vomited during the procedure and aspirated around 200ml. This in turn gave him asphyxiation pneumonia. He has since made his way out of the ICU and to the Neurological department where he is recovering from the pneumonia along with battling the brain stem infection. Louie has undergone several IVIg treatments this week to help with his brain swelling. His road to recovery includes being admitted into the neuro rehab training unit where they will help him work on gaining control of his speech and mobility again. The treatments, hospitalization and rehabilitation will be long and costly. The time frame for him to return home is unknown as brain injuries vary from person to person. All proceeds raised will be to help cover Louie’s medical expenses. ",8125,10000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/jordan-medlin-medical-care-fund,Jordan Sean Medlin Medical Care Fund," On July 23, 2021, Jordan Sean Medlin suffered a heart attack caused by a severe case of pneumonia. At some point during this cardiac episode, Jordan's brain was severely deprived of oxygen, leading to anoxic brain injury. Jordan currently cannot speak, is dependent on a feeding tube, and requires full assistance for every aspect of his care. Jordan's time at the Brain Rehabilitation Institute ends today, and he will be returned to his parents' home in Moon Township, PA. His parents will be his primary caregivers upon his return, with some push-in services from nurses and specialists, the cost of which is not yet known. His care will be a monumental challenge for everyone involved, but particularly his parents. Jordan's long term prognosis is uncertain. He is not fully catatonic, but he is also not fully conscious. It is what is known as a Disorder of Consciousness. He will look in the direction of someone's voice if they are calling his name, and will sometimes move his foot or his head on demand. Every professional we have spoken with has seen situations where people in Jordan's condition make meaningful progress, however, they have seen an equal number of cases where there isn't any progress beyond Jordan's current state. It is possible that Jordan may require his current level of care for the rest of his life. Jordan and his family need your help. The family is facing extensive long-term care and rehabilitation requirements for Jordan, as well as equipment purchases and renovations to their home to accommodate Jordan's new needs. Insurance covers only the bare basics in care and equipment, if they cover them at all. Due to Jordan's size (6'3"" - 280 lbs) and his parents' advancing years, they will require care and equipment that vastly exceeds Jordan's current insurance coverage. We will never give up on Jordan. He is a beautiful soul and a fighter. Anyone that has ever crossed paths with him knows the light and warmth his spirit brings into this world. He has a brutally difficult road ahead of him, but we are confident that someday, with enough faith, love and determination, we will get him back. We desperately ask for any donations you can give to Jordan's continued care, comfort, and rehabilitation while we work to accommodate his needs and facilitate his recovery. Jordan's family appreciates all of the prayers and messages of love that have come their way, but what Jordan's family urgently needs more than anything right now are financial resources beyond their current capabilities to provide him with the care and rehabilitation necessary to give him a chance at recovery. Any donation you make to that effort, no matter how small, will have a direct impact on Jordan's care. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support. -Team Jordan ",20950,125000,21-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/iamlayla,Help Layla Beat Brain Cancer (Rare & Aggressive),"Team fundraiserJanet Gonzales and Adela Kriland Lopez Bago are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Shawn Mahoney. Hi, my name is Janet Gonzales and I am raising money for my precious 6-year old granddaughter, Layla, who is battling an extremely rare and aggressive brain cancer, a high grade (WHO III) anaplastic supratentorial ependymoma. Less than 200 children per year get this type of brain cancer and to make matters worse, she has a rare strain. Layla had emergency, life-saving surgery on August 2nd, 2021 by Dr. Levy, to remove a massive tumor (images below). Layla was rushed to Rady's ER the day prior with unbearable headaches and vomiting. ""Save me, do something, help me,"" she kept screaming over and over to her helpless father. Layla has since had a second, brutal brain surgery on September 8th, as the tumor came roaring back in record time.  Radiation treatment (shown below) had to be delayed due to the tumor recurrence and second surgery to remove it, but is now commencing. with hopes of stopping it in its tracks. All fundraising approved by the family will be on this page only. Initially, Layla was brought to the ER on August 1st, with the thinking that she had a stomach virus and needed IV's but the parents were utterly shocked when a CT Scan revealed the tumor. The medical staff could not give her anything stronger than Tylenol since this was a brain/cognitive event and they needed her to be alert in order to show signs of a significant brain event requiring immediate action that could not wait for the main surgery team in the next (Monday) morning. That Sunday evening/night, for 18-hours straight she writhed in unimaginable pain, passing out over and over in front of her father who was helpless to do anything for her. For a while what type of cancer this was remained a mystery, but the parents called upon St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to be a second opinion and they nailed the diagnosis. To say that this all came on as a sudden shock would be an understatement. Her parents are taking unpaid leave and semi-paid leave during this time so the financial impacts have been immediate and severe. The out of pocket expenses not covered by insurance are expected to be substantial. Layla has loved animals since birth and wants to grow up to be a vet. She loves watching Dr. Pol and Yukon Vet on NatGeo, and wants to help the animals she loves, as well as other children. Because of this, her parents have decided that they want to do something fun and unique, and make this a multi-purpose FUN(d)raiser! Once the goal is hit, with a portion of the excess of the goal, Layla will make a donation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, as well as to the nature/animal focused non-profit(s) of her choosing. The theme here is, to help Layla, and at the same time help Layla help other children with the donation to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and help Layla help the animals that she loves so much by donating some of the proceeds to animal non-profit(s). The picture below is her at 6-months, with her dog on the first day we brought him home. And in the spirit of fun and giving, here is what we'd like to have everyone do: 1) Share it - Share it on social media, text this page link to friends so they too can watch the video, share it at work, share it anywhere you can think of 2) Donate - Thank you to all! 3) Be a FUN(d)raiser - Be a funder if you wish, but be a FUN(d)raiser - Go to your employer, tell them to get involved, donate or match and the same for your favorite brands you buy from, retailers, etc. 4) Contact your local media - Newspaper, radio station and TV station, share this story with them. Press goes a long, long way, especially with fun and unique causes Thank you to everyone supporting us through this difficult time. Let us hope that we can all use this as an example of how to do something like this going forward. Enjoy some additional photos of her below. We love her so much, she is such a special, brave, and incredibly strong child. ",72102,100000,20-Sep-21

As some of you may know, my best friend Elisha’s husband, Jerry Bozzi,  is battling for his life right now against the very aggressive Covid pneumonia. Jerry is a 55 year-old Long Island husband and father to Olivia, 20  and Damian, 17.  Jerry has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome and super imposed bacterial pneumonia since entering the hospital on September 22, 2021. He entered the hospital with a low oxygen saturation. Which was quickly diagnosed as covid pneumonia. After 11 days in the hospital he was put into sedation and put on a ventilator at 100% oxygen and taken up to the ICU.   Since entering ICU, he has been completely alone, as no visitors are allowed in. The nurses have held the phone up to his ear so that hopefully he can hear his wife and kids talk to him and tell him how much they love and need him.  We can’t even begin to imagine what Elisha  is going through. It’s been a heart wrenching and difficult time for the Bozzi family. Jerry is the life of the party type of guy. Funny and super chill.  A great husband /dad/friend. He has never met a person who has never been drawn to him.  A guy who loves his Pepsi, chocolate milk and his Jack & Ginger’s. And of course his big fur baby Mason.  We could only hope during this insanely difficult time, that we can at least take some of the financial burden off one’s shoulders. This will allow Elisha to focus on getting her husband back to health and taking care of her children and help tackle the accumulating medical bills.  Again, he has a long road ahead of him to recovery and he will not be able to support his family while in recovery.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/d37uv-help-coach-derek-sparks-conquer-pancreatic-cancer,Help Coach Derek Sparks Conquer Pancreatic Cancer,"Claudia H is organizing this fundraiser. To know Derek Sparks is to know that he has a habit of turning trials into triumph. This season, he is fighting his hardest battle yet: conquering Stage 4 Pancreatic Cancer. His remarkable football talents landed him in front of recruiters in high school, taking him to a successful career as a running back at his beloved alma mater, Washington State. When the former Cougar had his career cut short due to a series of injuries, his focus naturally shifted to empowering youth through sports. Now a high school administrator and assistant coach at NCAA Division III Pacific Lutheran University, Sparks has continued to use his knowledge of the game, both on and off the field, to help athletes navigate their own way into college sports. Naturally then, when his own daughter, Ze’Lee, was diagnosed with leukemia in 2018, Derek turned to what he knows best: football, and organized a charity all-star game in December of 2018, calling the event Cleats vs. Cancer. His intent was two-fold: showcase high school seniors to college coaches while raising awareness and money for fellow families battling childhood cancer. The event immediately caught on and has continued to thrive since, with Derek at the helm. Derek has spent his lifetime devoted to service and helping others. Now it's our time to help him. It's time for all of us to rise up to the challenge and raise funds to help him win his hardest battle yet by helping alleviate some of the financial stress he is under. The money raised from this campaign will all go directly towards assisting Derek pay medical-related expenses, and bills while he cannot work, and his family traveling back and forth from Seattle to help care for him.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/tim-tough-support-tim-hansens-cancer-fight,TimTOUGH! Support Tim Hansen's Cancer Fight!," As most are aware, three weeks ago Tim received the news that nobody wants to receive, he has cancer. After many scans, procedures, and tests, it so far appears the cancer is solely in his liver. On Friday October 29, Tim will have a procedure done to remove 50% of his liver to include the tumor and it’s surrounding area. He will most likely begin chemotherapy and radiation four weeks later. Tim has a fierce determination to fight his cancer and refuses to allow it to take him from his beautiful 3 year old triplet daughters and his beloved wife. For those of you who know Tim, know he is one of the most selfless and loving human beings who has always been there for his family, friends, and anyone in need. To countless MDA children and families, he has been a HERO, a shoulder to cry on, a source of strength and an inspiration.  Tim has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the MDA to fund research in finding a cure for Muscular Dystrophy.  He's volunteered thousands of hours for the MDA and most specifically as the MDA camp director for many years. Tim has a heart of gold and has spent his life investing in those he loves and helping others.  Tim’s sense of humor and positive demeanor leaves anyone in his presence with a smile.  Many people have reached out wondering how they can support Tim and his family during this new journey. The money raised will help alleviate some of the financial impact this diagnosis will have on Tim and his family. While it won’t be easy for Tim and his family to be on the receiving end of the support, it is our turn to give back. The Hansen Family is sincerely appreciative of the overwhelming love and support they have received. Tim is certainly not on this journey alone and with his positive attitude and the support he is surrounded with, cancer is messing with the wrong guy! #TimTOUGH Thank you for your generosity.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/donations-for-the-acevedo-family,Donations For The Acevedo Family," An unfortunate event had occur to our family on Monday October 18th 2021. What started out as a joyous family reunion to celebrate the youngest daughter's birthday had ended with heart wrenching tribulation. At the age of 46 years old, my father, Jose Francisco Acevedo was admitted to Orlando Regional Medical Center Emergency room where he was diagnosed with an Ischemic stroke. For those who are unaware, an Ischemic stroke is caused by a blockage in an artery that supplies blood to the brain. The blockage reduces the blood flow and oxygen to the brain, leading to damage or death of brain cells. If circulation isn’t restored quickly, brain damage can be permanent.  Medical staffs perform their job diligently and were able to locate and withdraw the hemorrhage from the parietal lobe of his brain. However, neurologists advised us that he isn’t clear to be in the safe zone yet. Jose will undergo three more surgical procedures including a tracheostomy (A medical procedure that involves creating an opening in the neck in order to place a tube into a person's windpipe.) within the following week. For now he is currently in the intensive care unit in a critical state with his devoted wife, Gisella Acevedo and the rest of our family members. Our family is facing a tremendous battle against this situation, and with that comes a financial battle to cover the costs. We are humbly asking for prayers and assistance from friends, families, and associates to help cover the costs he has incurred from the diagnosis, surgery, emergency transportation, and the on going treatment, medication, and appointments that he will experience in the upcoming months. My father is a loving man. My parents  have been married for nearly three decades, and he still goes out of his way to make her smile. A man who wholeheartedly devoted in the Lord’s name. He is the man that people look towards for guidance. He has always been there to listen to you whenever you have a problem or when you have accomplished something. He’s a man that has a great sense of humor or always tries to crack his corny dad jokes. Overall, he’s the foundation to our family and a pillar to the community. Watching him in this state is unbearable but despite the painful outcomes, our family is faithfully determined that we will overcome this. For we believe that with God, all things are possible.With much love,The Acevedo Family ""And Jesus said to him, “‘If you can’! All things are possible for one who believes.”"" Mark 9:23 ",12902,50000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/medical-expenses-and-support-for-sally-clinton,Medical expenses and support for Sally Clinton," Dear Friends and Family of Sally Clinton, As many of you know, our dear friend-sister-teacher Sally Clinton has had a pretty rough few years. Battling cancer while going through traumatic life events under very stressful circumstances has proven to be challenging on every level -- physical, emotional, spiritual, and financial. Despite these challenges, Sally has maintained the grace, compassion, dignity, optimism, and humor that we have all come to know and love. She is a remarkably resilient and wise human being. Those of us writing this letter have known Sally collectively for well over 350 years!! We continue to be awed by her resilience in the face of everything that she has had to endure these last many months. In the midst of a really frightening and disheartening time, what did Sally do? She solicited suggestions of favorite tunes from her friends so that she could dance with them in her heart. She will dance her way through this, no matter the outcome, and she has invited us to join her in that dance. Everyone who knows Sally is aware of the deep love and care she has for Earth, animals and all beings. Her life has been lived in service to all of that. Sally made conscious choices for animals and the earth as a child and teenager, was an activist in college, started a nonprofit when she was 25 and ran that as a full-time volunteer, introduced people of all ages to healthy eating and living, has supported hundreds of students and clients in their wellness journeys, volunteered to teach yoga in the local jail, offered free classes or a sliding scale or scholarships to those in need through yoga, Ayurveda, breathwork, health and healing, and much more. We have no doubt that Sally will continue to pay it forward and contribute in many ways to the greater good. Unfortunately, at this moment, she is facing another reality… Sally is fighting for her life. That’s the truth of the matter. She needs your help and our help in that fight. She needs us to stand alongside her. Many of you have already provided incredible emotional and spiritual support for her, for which she is immeasurably grateful. That support is priceless, but unfortunately not everything in this world is without a price. Sally has only been able to work minimally for several years. In addition to keeping herself going and being responsible for her two dogs, she has also been doing her best to keep her wellness studio afloat during this time. She has been largely supported and cared for throughout this ordeal by her amazing family, as well as some very generous friends. Medical debt now looms over all discussions of treatment options, potentially limiting Sally’s choices, and turning all logistical choices -- travel, lodging, food, medicine, etc. -- into financial calculations. Our country’s for-profit medical system, while incredibly advanced and full of amazing care providers of all kinds, is successful with some forms of cancer but is also limited in its approach to cancer treatment. Medical expenses for health crises are the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States. It breaks people. It breaks families. Many of the non-traditional, health supporting treatments and support that are helping Sally survive this challenge are not covered by any type of health insurance. This is also true of some of the cutting-edge treatments that she is considering. It is a situation that makes it necessary for us to pool money so that our dear friend is able to fight for her survival. It frustrates and saddens us, but this is where we are and we cannot turn away. We are our brothers’, and sisters’, keepers after all. Every dollar that we can provide for Sally will increase the chances that she survives this journey. That is not an exaggeration. We want her to survive because we love her and know she still has a lot to offer this world and the communities of which she is a part. We all want to dance with her again, and again after that, and yet again… Please donate anything that you can to this effort. Please feel free to share this with anyone else who may be able to offer financial assistance. No amount is too small or too large, and all are deeply appreciated. Do what you can. If you are able, consider contributing monthly or quarterly, as the needs will persist. This link will remain open until Sally is fully healthy and able to support herself again. Sincerely and Thank You! Keith Clinton (Sally’s brother) Susan McCarter King (her cousin) and just a few of her Beloved Friends: Judi Gladden, Stephanie Gress, Chris Gosster, Zoe Weil, Sessee Eartheart, Heart Phoenix, and Mark Read  Please share this anyone else  who may be in a position to help support  Sally in her life and needs.  !

https://www.gofundme.com/f/needs-a-title,WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS:  PLEASE HELP COCO !," One of the kindest and hardest working mamas WE know needs our help! Courtenay has been an inspiring and creative force in Louisville for decades, as well as a single, working mom to Max and Ava for 16 years. She is the co-founder of the popular  Flea Off Market and helped grow it to its current success before moving on.  Like many in the 21st century economy, she has always worked multiple jobs to make ends meet.  Through her natural talents and self-taught skills, she has supported her home and children through hard work in landscape design, photography, and creating delicious and healthy meals to clients .   Now, against the backdrop of Co-VID, a collection  of awful circumstances have combined --leaving  Courtenay and her family in an unimaginably difficult situation.  They need our help.Several weeks ago, Courtenay's son Max was hospitalized after he unexpectedly fainted at school. After days of uncertainty, the doctors finally came up with a diagnosis--a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST ), a large cancerous  mass on his stomach.   This mass has been the source of constant blood loss, that went undetected until he passed out at school.  Because he was admitted to the hospital with dangerously low hemoglobin levels, Max required several blood transfusions during his several-day stay in the hospital. Surgery is the next step, scheduled for November 15, 2021.  The course of recovery and any further treatment will unfold in the next few weeks.  And, while Courtenay is lucky to be able to cover the children with Medicaid insurance,  there will be out of pocket medical costs to cover.   After diagnosis and before surgery, Max has been completing school work at home and required to quarantine to avoid COVID prior to surgery. Due to Max's medical situation, Courtenay has had to take time away from her jobs to get him to doctor's appointments and testing and coordinate his schooling with JCPS.   Because trouble never seems to travel alone, the family's mini van began having transmission-problems.  So repairing or replacing the vehicle is a necessity to keeping this family afloat as well.   Then, in the midst of this clearly crisis situation, the children's father has chosen to demand custody rather than help.   This has necessitated Courtenay to miss more work to look for representation and take care of all that goes with responding to something like this.  She has secured representation for this case and legal expenses are high and constantly rising. Most of us know what it's like to face at least one of these challenges, which would strain the finances of most.  We  are  lucky to not have to face them all at once!   For 16 years, Courtenay has sustained  her family on her own --with hard work and determination even during the CoVid shutdown.   At the same time, as a friend and community member,  she has given constantly in the nearly 30 years we've known her.    In  the current situation, under these extraordinary circumstances, she needs our  help. So we are asking  all who read this, please help  give back to her and her family during this unprecedented time of  financial, medical, emotional and mental strain.  Together,  we can help them as they move through the diagnosis and treatment, the day to day costs and stresses of life, and all the work required to obtain proper child support, establish official custody and parenting time that is best for the children. Thank you for any help you can offer, even $1 will be helpful and deeply appreciated. Often we find ourselves without that dollar to give, and that is ok.  Sharing the fundraiser is also a welcome donation!More information & updates on Max at the CARING BRIDGE SITE  ",3415,6500,20-Oct-21

Corporal Kelsee Lainhart was seriously injured in the suicide bombing attack at the Kabul Airport on August 26th while fulfilling her duties to the Marines.  Kelsee sustained serious injuries and will have long road of rehabilitation and recovery ahead of her.  She is a strong, beautiful, brave young woman with a bright future ahead of her and we know she can do it!! Words from her Mother:  Kelsee realized in her Junior Year of High School that she wanted to become a Marine after a friend of hers ask her to come to “friend” weekend with the National Guard.  After returning home from that weekend, she said “I’m joining the Marines, as I want to do more.”  And she set her mind that weekend that this is what she was going to do.  She spent her entire Senior Year of High School in the Poolee program which mentally and physically trained her for what she’d experience in Boot Camp.  She entered Boot Camp right after graduation and before she was 18 years old.   She was very determined and wanted to train as much as possible.  She had hopes of getting her “jump wings” and “dive wings” and she was super excited about her first deployment.  Never did her family expect her to be in Afghanistan, but she had no fear.  She felt like she was helping so many women and children in hopes of them having a better future.  A day before the accident, she said she was sad about anyone that might be left behind.  She is truly a selfless person, a complete badass, and a true hero!! We appreciate anything that you can donate to help Kelsee.  These funds will be used for any medical expenses, specialists, travel, etc. that will not be covered by the US Military to help Kelsee in her recovery. We are also asking for prayers.  She needs all that she can get. Thanks for your support. ♥️ ",111359,200000,31-Aug-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ivan-fight-for-his-life,Help.... Ivan Douglas is Fighting for his Life,"Kimberly Ford is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Lauren Douglas. Ivan Douglas (also known as ID) is a loving husband, father of 2 boys (3 and 1years old),son and friend to many. He is an Ohio State Alumni and former OSU football player and a 2002 OSU champion. ID has a giving spirit and is a people person; he meets no strangers. Due to his 6ft 7 in stature and calm demeanor we lovingly call him a gentle giant. ID is the bread winner for his family & currently employed as a Social Worker to help children in crisis. Right now ID is in very critical condition and is fighting for his life. Ivan contracted COVID-19 and was hospitalized on Sep 22, 2021. When ID arrived at the hospital he was purple in color and his oxygen level was at 63%. The medical professionals scrambled to attend to him and get him admitted to the ICU. The doctors said that if ID had not came to the hospital when he did he would have died. ID is still in the ICU and fighting for his life. The doctors have said that his COVID lungs are SEVERELY damaged and he is unable to breath on his own. In order to keep ID alive he had to be put into a medically induced coma and put on a ventilator. The doctors say the best why to try to help ID's lungs get oxygen to heal is to position him on his stomach (proning); this is not an easy task at 6ft 7in tall and 359lbs. They tried to get a proning bed but ID is too large for the bed so instead the medical staff has to paralzye ID from the neck down and manually turn his body over everyday twice a day. Each time this process takes a team of 10 medical professionals to safely and successfully prone ID all while he is still on the ventilator and in a coma. Proning has allowed ID's oxygen levels to get slightly better but he is still completely dependent on the ventilator. Because he is not getting the appropriate oxygen to his organs ID's kidneys are now failing and he started his first of many dialysis treatments this week. The doctors say the slight improvement in his oxygen levels is a baby step in the right direction but he is still in a very critical condition and is not out the woods; he has a long road ahead. Honestly it's day by day. We ask that you please pray for ID's recovery and if you are able please donate to help with his mounting medical bills and living expenses for his wife Lauren who is a at home mom and their 2 toddlers Mason and Greyson.  Thank you. ",23042,60000,17-Oct-21

Shane was diagnosed with a genetic heart condition 8 years ago when he was only 21 years old. Shortly after his diagnosis Shane had his first open heart surgery where he received an aortic valve replacement. Shane is a thirty year old Carpenter Foreman employed with McCarthy Building Companies.  Shane’s goal is to continue in his father's footsteps and work his way up to the Superintendent role at McCarthy; the same company his father Jim worked for throughout his thirty year career in construction. Shane and Jim have a shared passion for building challenging construction projects as well as building lasting friendships with almost everyone they meet and work with. Anyone who has had the pleasure of working with Shane can agree that he has the biggest heart, always goes the extra mile, and is committed 100% in everything he does. In a recent check-up Shane was given the unfortunate news that his heart valve has deteriorated and will need to be replaced as well as the possibility of getting a pacemaker implanted to help regulate his heartbeat. The doctors are very optimistic that this second surgery will make him stronger, ready for anything, and improve his overall lifestyle and daily energy level. Thankfully, Shane has medical insurance through the Carpenter's Union and that should cover a majority of his surgery expenses. However, Shane is not eligible for short-term disability while he recovers over the next 3 months. The money raised through this platform will help cover out of pocket medical bills associated with the procedure and monthly living expenses while Shane is out of work.

The Peterson family has always been one of the first to offer help to others. It is now our time to offer that same sense of community to them.  A couple of weeks ago Phil was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome.  He was hospitalized for 10 days and was released home with foot braces and a walker.  Due to his preexisting health conditions his immune system has been hit hard and is extremely weak.  His physician wants him to do another round of Rituxan Chemo to get his immune system back on track.  Due to it being flu/cold season and covid his physician will not release him back to work until he has received the chemo and has more strength in both legs.  He will be applying for short-term disability, however he will need to go 30 days without pay before he is eligible. It is expected that Phil will be out of work for 6-12 months.  As a result, the Peterson’s are experiencing a significant change in income. The funds raised will be used to offset this loss of income so they may continue to meet the needs of their family. Additionally, the costs incurred by hospitalizations, treatments, and the needed physical therapy will be significant. Funds raised will also be used to help the Peterson’s cover these costs.

I am 30 years of age and the COO of Mikwats Fresh Squeeze, a natural fruit juice processing company in Ghana which is a family owned business. Early February, I nearly had a fatal accident when I couldn’t see a car approaching.My cousin took the wheels afterwards. Next day I went to an eye clinic and I was given some tests to run and bring the results. I later started experiencing severe headaches and periodic blackouts. I was then referred to the korle bu teaching hospital for further investigations and series of scans, tests and MRIs were conducted. I was diagnosed with Pituitary Macro-adenoma with mass effects blinding my left eye and gradually creeping onto my right eye. I needed an emergency surgery considering the severity of the tumor . I had the 1st surgery on 29th April, 2021 and was following  through with the mandatory reviews and visits to specialists. Barely some weeks after surgery my eye sight hadn’t improved. I kept having periodic headaches and my menses wouldn’t stop even till date.My endocrinologist also got alarmed and requested for an MRI immediately because my hormonal levels were extremely low. On 2nd July 2021, the scan was done and reports showed that the tumor post surgery is as big as before surgery. In a confused state as to why the tumor was still present. A meeting was organized between myself, my family and the team of surgeons that operated on me. It came out during the meeting that they couldn’t take out all of it out and therefore suggested I will have to go through the same procedure 4-6 times in order for me to be out of danger. After series of conversations, both parties agreed I seek a 2nd opinion and do the surgery abroad. The doctors got a hospital for me in New York, USA and sent all my scans and MRIs. The hospital in New York assigned a neurosurgeon to my case and thankfully they are well equipped to combine three procedures in one surgery. I am therefore appealing to you to come to my aid. The total cost of my treatment is estimated at US$283,000 and my family cannot raise this amount. I know we are in difficult times but please help me by donating any amount to my GOFundme account.

On Thursday, September 30th, Jason Schulz suffered a massive heart attack, and a subsequent anoxic brain injury, while at his home in north Lake Tahoe, California.  He was taken by helicopter to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, for emergency heart surgery and other lifesaving support.  For 16 days, Jason lay intubated and in a medical coma.  However, with the odds stacked against him, he fought back and, miraculously, regained consciousness and began to breathe on his own.  Jason fought because of the unbounding love he has for his wife Brooke, his family, and his amazing friends both near and far.Jason has a long road back to independence and his life before his heart attack.  The lack of oxygen to his brain has caused severe enough damage that he can’t walk, feed himself, or clearly remember people, places and things in his life and the world.  He has a long road to recovery, and it won’t be easy, but his doctors believe that one day he will be able to live an independent life doing the things he loves so much - sharing life together with Brooke, and golfing, skiing, hiking, and popping a fine bottle of Barolo at the end of his day with his dear friends and family.The doctors believe that Jason will be able to return to work at some point, but there is no time-frame on the horizon.

My nephew Lester Reina Olavarría (""Lete"" as his relatives know him), 33, is currently in critical condition with COVID-19 in Venezuela.Despite taking all precautions, including vaccination, his pre-existing LUPUS skin condition has complicated the course of the disease. Sadly, Lete is another victim of the pandemic we are living through.Since October 3, Lester has maintained care at home for a week with expensive medications and 24-hour specialist care. Later he was hospitalized and his condition continues to be delicate.The insurance company has not responded according to the policy contracted, and will not be responsible for any of the expenses. Due to his current state of health and the treatments and care he still needs, these expenses are growing rapidly, and it is for this reason that we resort to this means.Without the help of family and friends like you, it will not be within our means to meet the expenses that are required.Your generous financial help today will give Lete a better chance to overcome this terrible virus.We thank you in advance and from the bottom of our hearts for the help you can give us and for spreading this message among your family and friends.

Cowboy boots and unicorns... but on September 2nd, she was diagnosed with a inoperable form of brain cancer, called Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. She will require 6 weeks of Radiation therapy, and is expected to be in the Phoenix area for the next 8-10 weeks for treatment. Both Mom and Dad will have extensive time away from work to attend her medical needs, as it recommended that she stay near Phoenix Childrens and the Mayo Hospital until radiation therapy is completed... This has absolutely devastated her family, and is still unfathomable. Because of the duration of treatment, expenses and such, we are humbly asking for your support... her Mom, Dad and 6 month old sister Aalayna are a young family just getting established in their lives, and this will easily overwhelm them...

https://www.gofundme.com/f/7a2ph-help-jack-fight-cancer,Help Jack Fight Cancer,"Michele Renee is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jamie Waterman. Hello everyone. This fundraiser is for a good friend, Jamie and Cortlyn Waterman's son, Jack. It's every parent's worst nightmare: a trip to the hopital for their 3 year old son's stomach mass being discovered eventually resulting in a diagnosis of Pediatric Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma)- which is a form of kidney cancer. Jack had to be admitted to the Pediatric Oncology Division at Golisano Children's Hospital which cares for children with cancer. A CT scan confirmed the doctors assumption; Jack has Pediatric Wilms Tumor (Nephroblastoma). This type of cancer requires high-level surgical expertise to treat. Jamie and Cortlyn wait patiently for the doctors to determine a treatment plan. Typically, treatment is initial surgery followed by 9-12 weeks of chemotherapy. However, Jack falls into the small portion of 5-10% of patients, that have tumors and cancer in both kidneys. Due to this, Jamie and Cortlyn can not risk surgery up front. Jack has 4 tumors in his right kidney and at least 4 tumors in his left. However, his left kidney is under a lot of stress, has fluid building up around it and is starting limit the ability of urine to leave it. Due to this, Jack's oncology team needs to collaborate with several other teams before Jamie and Cortlyn get the official diagnosis and treatment plan. Jack’s spirits are high. Jack is being spoiled rotten by all the nurses. Jack is enjoying the constant supply of snacks, movies and faces coming and going. Jamie and Cortlyn appreciate the outpouring of love, encouragement, texts, phone calls and prayers. If you are able to, please donate to help out Jack's parents, for Jack's medical expenses. If you are not able to donate, please keep Jack and his whole family in your prayers. Thank you. ",29396,30000,18-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/prayers-for-weston-paul,Prayers for Weston Paul," Hi, my name is Hayley and I am fundraising for my dear friends Justice and Dale's baby boy Weston Paul. He has been very sick with RSV and is only 4 weeks old. I will copy and paste Justices posts from her FB page so you can read in her own words what has been happening. We are wanting to help out any way we can and this seems like the best way we can all come together to help them. The PICU is extremely hard on finances and anyone with babies who have gone through it know. Justice and Dale did not ask for this but I would like us all to be able to gift to them during this time. We are also asking for as many prayers as possible for baby Weston to be strong and to pull through quickly.  Post 1 Oct 26th 9am: ""I know you see posts like this often. About how RSV can affect little ones and how to be careful. But maybe just one more post can help another baby. Annistyn tested positive last week due to an exposure at daycare, this is her second time with it and she handled it like a pro. She’s completely better now, yay. However, Weston tested positive on Sunday. And yesterday he started having difficulty breathing and while getting ready to head to the ER he stopped breathing. I gave my 4 week old baby CPR. No one should ever have to experience that.  When we arrived to the ER he was stable but still breathing very fast and retracting. The doctors wanted to send us home because his oxygen level looked normal. Even though he was working hard to get to the normal range.  We told them we didn’t feel comfortable leaving and he didn’t appear normal to us. So they basically said for peace of mind they’d see if we could stay… Within minutes of being admitted and entering the pediatric floor, he was declining and had to be put on oxygen. He still wasn’t doing well. He was eventually put on as much oxygen as the general pediatric floor would allow and was transferred to the intermediate care unit where he still struggled on 8L of oxygen, which is the max for his weight.  We were transferred to the pediatric ICU where we will continue to be for the next few days.  Please make sure if you or your children are experiencing any symptoms, you stay home. While one person you may pass a virus onto can handle it, the next one… can’t.  And also, make sure you advocate for your kids. You know your kids better than anyone. If we would have went home, who knows what would have happened."" Post 2 October 27th: ""Update: unfortunately, he is being intubated now. Please keep the prayers coming, as one of Weston’s lungs collapsed and he is still working very hard. We are praying we won’t have to intubate. Trying a bunch of things to try and prevent that ❤️"" Post 3 Oct 28th 8am: ""I beg of you. Please keep sick kiddos home and hold your babies tight.  I hope no one has to see some of the things we have and go through what we have in the past few days.  This morning has been extremely hard and extremely scary. Please continue to send good vibes and prayers."" Post 4 Oct 28th 11am: ""Unfortunately, this morning while moving him to put the X-ray plate under him, he tried coughing and obviously couldn’t because of the tube and stopped breathing and his heart completely stopped. They bagged him until he started breathing and his heart started again. They have him fully sedated to ensure he won’t wake up to cough again.  However, roughly an hour ago, our nurse noticed the fluid vitals low (which means there was fluid build up,) she tried suctioning it out and his airway became blocked and it all happened again.. they call it “mucus plugging” and is unfortunately normal with RSV patients that are intubated. They were able to bag him back to normal vitals again and he is sedated and doing okay as of now.  We hope this doesn’t continue to happen and they are going to try suctioning him more frequently to prevent mucus plugging again.  We truly have an amazing team here in the PICU. They have not blinked when it came time to help him when he’s needed it most. They have worked fast and diligently. I can tell you, seeing your baby’s chest not rising is something that… you will never forget. And i can’t stop staring at him and his vitals. I’m not sure how dale and I will ever recover from what we have seen and just hope this bad dream ends soon."" We appreciate anything anyone is giving to help this sweet family, even if it is prayers or $1. God has Weston in his hands and we are so thankful for that as well. ",3445,25000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-joe-with-quality-of-life,Help Joe with Quality of Life,"Team fundraiserMarie Strait and Jeannie Strait are organizing this fundraiser.WHO WE ARE Hello everyone. Our names are Marie and Jeannie. We are sisters who have set up this GoFundMe for our father, Joe, who is in immense physical pain every single day and is losing his hope for living. As of today (9/19/21), he does not know that we have set this fundraiser up. We hope that by sharing his story, we can somehow get him the help he needs... because after 3 long years of agony...we also do not know what to do anymore. Please take a moment to read his story and grant us the chance to inspire you. Thank you so much.  WHO IS JOE?This is Joe- a hardworking, funny, and passionate man. Father and hero to three.  He has devoted most of his life to supporting his family and helping others.During our years growing up, our father worked 2 to 3 jobs to keep the roof over our heads and food on our table. When that no longer was sufficient, Dad took to traveling to work disaster relief after devastating hurricanes and floods hit around the U.S.- Hurricane Katrina, Louisiana - 2005 - Hurricane Rita, Louisiana - 2005 - The Floods in Iowa - 2008- Hurricane Ike, Texas - 2008 - BP Oil Spill, Florida Panhandle - 2010To do these jobs, Dad had to leave everything behind for several months at a time (his home, his family, and his comfort), and set out to face the unknown.During this time, he lived in his small utility trailer and tent on empty camp sites - without electricity, regular food or water, the comfort of actual shelter or sleep for extended periods of time- in order to help Americans who were in crisis, and provide for his family back home.This is just one of the many instances that he has put his wants, comforts, and feelings aside to help others. We use this to help to explain to you just what type of man he is, what he holds dear, and what standards he holds himself to.A TURN FOR THE WORSE  After decades of physical labor, two unforeseeable injuries, and two back surgeries (2018 & 2019)...Dad now suffers from severe neuropathy and spinal cord injuries that make routine things like showering and getting to the grocery store extremely difficult and at times impossible. To paint this picture a little more vividly, Dad’s neuropathy causes a horrible burning sensation throughout his feet and legs. This has gotten progressively worse throughout the 3 years since it has started. His nerve damage is so extreme that he can no longer walk on the floor with bare feet because the cold floor HURTS, so he wears socks 24/7, night and day. He was also forced to give up wearing regular close-toed shoes due to pain. And now, as it has gotten worse… Dad even feels pain when the fan blows air on his feet. The newest development is that the pain is starting to travel up his legs as far as his thighs. He fears the future may hold amputation of his feet and legs and a permanent confinement to a wheelchair.  NOT WITHOUT A COST We are fighting tooth and nail to keep up with medical costs. Insurance + co-pays, medical bills, and prescriptions average out to be about $2,700 / month out of pocket! This is before attempting to still cover the mortgage, car insurance, phone bill and food. This year alone he has paid $27,000 in doctors bills- not including the cost of living expenses. For the last 2 years he has been surviving off of his life savings that he has worked his entire life for and it is almost completely gone.There is real fear that Dad will have to give up his house just to maintain living with health insurance. As he does the math over and over, he does not see how he can keep both if we do not come into a financial miracle.WHAT WE'RE DOING TO HELPHis condition keeps him incapable of working. So his 3 children do everything they can to offset the immense stress that he is under. Jeannie is the last of his children living with him at home. She has recently taken on a second job in addition to her full time job to help alleviate some pressure and buy some time. She routinely cooks dinner with dad, and spends time with him at home because that is where he is mostly confined to. She consistently sees the unbearable pain he is in, and it is taking an emotional toll on her, as well as the rest of the family.I and our brother often send money home, help with paperwork, and collect more resource information. Answers and relief have been far and few between. A lot of government resources require an individual to be homeless or completely destitute in order to qualify (Medicaid).He isn’t old enough yet for social security, but we are pursuing his disability case that hopefully will get approved. Usually they get denied multiple times and can take 4-5 years on average to be approved.  OUR WISHAs his condition and financial security deteriorate, we are doing what we can to keep hope alive. Our wish is to be able to keep the house and his healthcare until we can get his disability approved and get some additional income coming in. We have put the goal at $50,000 because we estimate that that would give us approximately a year and a half more to work on the disability case. ($50,000 divided by $3,000/month = 16.66 months)During that time, the $50,000 would go to paying for our father’s medical bills, and pain management so he can focus on living with less pain and stress, and the rest of the family can focus on paying the mortgage and other regular expenses. (We are happy to speak in length about our situation with any serious donors and will happily submit receipts of money used to the donor directly. )Our deadline to raise this money is December 31, 2021 because that is the last day of Dad's health insurance based on our current financial projections.  At that time, we will be faced with the decision to sell our house.HOW YOU CAN HELPIf you have the means to donate today, your contribution will not go unnoticed. We know that so many people are suffering right now, and even the smallest gesture makes a difference. If you aren’t able to donate today, we ask that you please SHARE our dad’s story WITH a short caption of something that inspired you. The more people that see this.. the more likely we are to reach our goal. If 1,000 people donated $50, that would be the miracle we have been praying for. THANK YOU ALL FOR READING. We cannot express it enough how much it means that you took the time to do so. ",6955,50000,18-Sep-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/q2dx5-help-for-nova,Help for Nova," On December 22, 2020, my nephew Dylan took his laboring wife, Chelsea to the hospital for the much anticipated birth of their third son, Nova. They were so ready! But nothing could have prepared the young family for the tragic news that their sweet little boy had a knot in his umbilical cord. It had caused unrepairable damage, and their little guy's prognosis wasn't very good. Nova had everyone fooled though, because months later he is living and melting any heart that will look in his direction. Sadly, being discharged from the hospital has presented a new set of challenges that have forced Dylan and Chelsea to look at their home, car, and basically everything that once was normal, through the eyes of their tiny miracle baby.  They have taken on each obstacle with the same fight that Nova gives every second just to live, but they can't do any of it without a vehicle big enough to hold all of Nova's medical equipment (part of which keeps him breathing) so he can go to his many doctor's appointments. As you can imagine having two boys, a baby and all his necessary medical equipment can make going out together very difficult. They could really use a little help and I want to do all I can to contribute, so I've started this GoFundMe page to help them get a wheelchair accessible van. Nothing I have said above can capture the special spirit of Nova quite like his father's words below. Please take a second to read, share their story and help out if you can!…..If there is one thing you can say about Nova, it’s that he is a fighter. Born with his umbilical cord wrapped in a knot, Nova had to fight from the moment he was brought into this world. He developed two masses on his spine, taking away feeling, strength, and movement in the lower half of his body. He had no core strength, couldn’t empty his bladder, swallow his feed, and most devastating; breathe on his own. But like I said; dude is a fighter. Despite the odds, doctors doubts, and all the things stacked against him, Nova got better and better. After 3 procedures, countless X-Rays, numerous MRI’s, and 6 months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Nova fought his way home for the first time. Home to his two brothers for the first time. Home to his Noni, and Poppa, and Granny, and Aunt, and Uncle, and so on and so forth. Nova had won that fight. Sadly, Nova will never stop fighting. Luckily, he’s ok with that. Through it all Nova has always had a sense of joy. From the time he could start smiling, he hasn’t stopped, he is genuinely the happiest baby you’ll come in contact with. Happy and growing. That was almost 5 months ago, our near 11 month old baby is now wearing 24 MONTH CLOTHES. But not only is he outgrowing his clothes. He’s outgrowing his little car seat. He’s outgrowing his old equipment. And with a growing baby, and hordes of new equipment. We as a family are outgrowing our vehicle. As I said, Nova comes with a lot. His car seat, his ventilator, his oxygen tank, his backup oxygen tank, his pulse-oxometer, his suction machine, his food pump, his emergency bag, his diaper bag, his stroller, etc. And that’s just now; he has been fitted for a new car seat, stroller, and therapy chair. Sadly, we don’t have the storage for his abundance of necessities. So despite our independent nature, this is us asking for your assistance… Any help to support this young family would be greatly appreciated! ",5480,7500,21-Oct-21

It is the home of the Tower! You would also know that Mark, the owner (and the chef, and the behind the scenes person), is always there working.  Mark was just recently diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and is undergoing severe, intense treatments. He is unable to work. Mark is not strong enough and therefore Abbie's Diner has been on a very scaled back schedule.  Dave, a chef that helps Mark, Mondays through Fridays early in the mornings, is there for those hours, but otherwise, Abbie's has been closing early Mondays through Fridays and Abbie's has not been able to be open on Saturdays and Sundays as those were the days that Mark did all the cooking from open to close.  Saturdays and Sundays are Abbie's Diner's bread and butter.  So with the very modified schedule during the week and the closing on Saturday and Sunday, Mark's business has taken a hit.  Additionally, now Mark has the incredible expense of fighting this disease. I have been going to Abbie's Diner since my husband, Chris, and I moved to Wyckoff almost 20 years ago.  I go there for my morning coffee and throughout the years, we have gone with our 4 kids after church or after sports games for their amazing pancakes, eggs, hamburgers, grilled cheeses and, of course, the Tower.  Even all my nephews and nieces that live all around the country want to go to Abbie's when they are visiting NJ! Abbie's is the place you can call the day before an early morning road trip to a far away soccer tournament or dance competition and ask Mark to have your breakfast ready at 4:30 am and he'll have it ready for you just the way you like it!  Abbie's is the place you run into your neighbor or a friend, or meet a new friend, too.  Sit at the counter, eat at one of the tables, or take it to go, whatever you want, Abbie's is the place!   I ask that you pray for Mark.  Additionally, if you could contribute any amount to help defray the cost of Mark's treatments as well as his scaled back schedule for Abbie's, I know Mark would greatly appreciate it. I would, too.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/eyqfz6-taylor-strong,Taylor Strong," Hi y'all, my name is Mina and I created this GoFundMe in honor of my cousin Jeb, and his wife Taylor who recently got diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 29. After losing my aunt, Jeb's mother, to cancer in January of this year, our family never expected this diagnosis and to be thrown back into dealing with this terrible disease. Despite how devastating this news is, we are ready to fight and believing in God for miraculous healing and for financial provision. That's where y'all come in! Praise God that Taylor has great medical coverage, so that need is being met. However, Jeb and Taylor are currently without a reliable vehicle to transport Taylor to her doctors appointments. They are 2 hours away, and since they live in Colorado, it's starting to snow, and they definitely need something that can withstand the tough winter. Additionally, Jeb and Taylor intended to spend this year traveling across the country in their RV with their two dogs. Sadly, this plan changed due to my aunt passing and then this diagnosis. This currently leaves Jeb and Taylor living in their RV on her dad's property with their two dogs, which again is not ideal for a CO winter. My hope with this fundraiser is that you will partner in generosity with me to help Jeb and Taylor purchase a reliable car and have a nest egg to put down on a place of their own. Both of these things are essential to Taylor being able to kick cancer's butt! We are ready to fight and contend for her through prayer, but we need your help! If you find it in your heart to donate, know that any amount would be a giant blessing to this beautiful couple. And if money is tight, I certainly hope that you join us in prayer for healing for Taylor. God bless y'all! #Taylorstrong ",9105,15000,3 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/marys-fight-fund,Mary’s Fight Fund," Hello Everyone, Many of you know Mary from any number of the community organizations she has been involved with over the last 30 some years in New Albany and the greater Columbus area. From being a parent volunteer in the New Albany School District, to the athletic boosters, the McCoy Center for the Arts, NAWN, Church of the Resurrection, New Albany Walking Club, Rotary and more. There’s nothing Mary loves more than interacting with and helping people, especially the people of her community. Mary has constantly puts others before herself and jumps to help those in need whenever and wherever she can. As most of you know, Mary fought and beat breast cancer (twice) about 20 years ago. Unfortunately, as we have learned, breast cancer often returns and when it does, it comes back with a vengeance. At the beginning of July Mary was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. As a result of the cancer Mary’s mobility has been significantly impacted and she has been staying at and receiving therapy from Wesley Woods in New Albany. Mary is working with an amazing team of doctors, nurses and staff members at the James Cancer Center at Ohio State, Wesley Woods New Albany and Ohio Living Home Health. She is currently undergoing rounds of chemo that have shown to be working at this time. It is a slow process however and some of the treatment, equipment and level of care Mary needs extends beyond what insurance will cover.  We’re hoping to raise anywhere from $25,000-50,000 to help cover these necessary expenses for the unforeseeable future as Mary continues to battle breast cancer. Mary has remained super positive through the whole process and has slowly but surely been making progress each week as she continues her treatments and therapy. It’s cliche but it’s so true -- any little bit helps and if a financial donation isn’t feasible for you please consider simply sending your love and support Mary’s way. We are overwhelmed by the outpouring of love and support Mary has received from friends, family, medical professionals and community members thus far. We hope that this love and support continues as it makes such a difference and we appreciate you all so very much!  ",17963,25000,21-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-martijn-de-bruijn-as-he-beats-stage-4-cancer,Help Martijn de Bruijn kiss cancer goodbye!,"Team fundraiserAnne-Marije Short and 0 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Abigail Anderson. Hi, my name is Anne-Marije and I am fundraising for my best friend Martijn de Bruijn. If you know Martijn de Bruijn, then you are one of the lucky ones. He is the clown, the one who never fails to make you laugh, who makes you feel uplifted, welcome and wanted. He is the most down to earth and positive guy I know. You just can’t help but love him. He’s that kinda guy! Four years ago Martijn was diagnosed with colorectal cancer. It turned his world upside down and a rollercoaster period of chemotherapy treatment followed as well as having surgery to remove the tumor and to add a colostomy bag to allow for his body to heal. A year later Martijn finally got the all clear. We celebrated big! We had him back! But shortly thereafter, he received the devastating news that his cancer had come back, but this time it had spread to his lungs and liver. The chemotherapy treatment he received made him really sick. Since, he’s received endless chemotherapy and radiation treatments to try and attack the cancer and his body has suffered greatly as a result. Despite all this, he continues working as much as he can and never fails to be the first one to show up to offer help, make people laugh, and to be the life and soul of the party. The forever optimist. A few months ago Martijn started having debilitating back pains and it turned out that the cancer had also spread to his bones. Then the other day, he noticed a lump on the side of his head which is growing rapidly. This has affected his vision and forces him to stay home more often. More scans followed and it turned out that there is a tumor growing inside of his head as well as in his small intestines and more spots on his lungs and liver. This is a critical time for Martijn. A recent study was done on Martijn’s cancer in Europe to help determine the best route to go on treatments to tackle his cancer. From those results they discovered they could get most of these treatments done in Mexico. There are no effective treatments left available to him here in the US. With this information we have hope that this will help kill his cancer. It is a long and costly road ahead, and it will take time and patience to get there. Martijn (44) is an incredible father of two sweet young girls, Sophie (9) and Olivia (5), a loving husband to his wonderful wife Gail (38), friend, brother, son and so much more to all of those that know him and love him. Gail has been his ever present rock. And his two girls his source of pure joy. Martijn and Gail met almost 20 years ago in Holland. Gail, an Irish girl, fell in love with Martijn. They have been together and very much in love with each other ever since. They got married and made a major decision to move to California almost 11 years ago with a dream to build up a new life here, have kids, animals on a little ranch where they could also grow their own vegetables and flowers. Martijn’s passion is growing and has done that his whole life. His favorite hobby is to be out fishing with his friends. Anyone who has had the privilege to meet, or spend time with Martijn and Gail and their girls knows they are simply amazing. They are amongst the strongest people I know. They went through the terrible loss of Martijn’s mother to breast cancer only just over a year ago with remarkable strength. I am so sad to say that it is now his turn to fight for his life so he can live to see his little girls graduate from school, and continue to celebrate their milestones with them and all the joys life has to offer their family for years to come. He has been working so hard towards realizing their big dream of owning a little ranch and then cancer happened. He would give anything to make that happen. How you can help Martijn does everything in life with passion. Anyone who knows him knows what a fighter he is. I have never met a person as selfless as Martijn. He always puts others first and cares deeply for those around him. He is incredibly kind-hearted, generous, selfless and always there for a friend. Now it is our turn to be there for him and support him as he fights for his life and battles this deadly disease. As you can imagine, the weight of all of this on Martijn and his family is incredible. There are still many unknowns as to the treatment in the months ahead, but one thing that is very well known is the financial burdens that Martijn and his family have had to endure already. Medical costs, fueling Martijn's body for optimum healing, and every day financial responsibilities continue to grow. And now, as Martijn focuses on fighting the biggest battle of his life, we want to help lighten this financial burden so they can focus on the lifesaving treatment and medical support he needs to survive. Martijn is determined to fight this cancer, and come out even stronger on the other side. At this critical time, he needs your generous support to get him through and be prepared for what lies ahead. With your help this will make it possible to do these special treatments and help save his life. Thank you all for taking the time to visit this page. Please share this information on your social media platforms. Thank you for all your love, prayers, and support. What a blessing you are to Martijn and his beloved girls. As we learn more, I will update you frequently. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly with any questions on how to help!

I love the life I’ve built with my family, my farm, and my community, but my health has not sustained the ability to work a full-time job in those years.  This past February, a pain crisis led to the discovery of yet another layer to my health issues: multiple ovarian and uterine tumors. While we were immensely relieved that all tests proved them benign, I underwent a hysterectomy. Healing, physically, has taken much of this year, and we are still adjusting emotionally to the unexpected end to our hope of more children.  Humbling as it is to ask for help, my medical bills, combined with the ways my unpredictable energy levels make it difficult for me to earn money, have made this year difficult for us. After insurance, my bills from the tests before and after surgery, my hospital stay, and the surgery itself, totaled more than $8,000 out of pocket. With a generous gift from our church, and budgeting from Ryan’s hard work to provide for us, we’ve paid almost half.  Now, with the end of the year approaching, the rest of it is coming due and, humbling as it is to ask for help, we could really use the support of our friends in ending this painful chapter of our lives. Thank you for, again and again, reminding us that we are not alone in the joys and sorrows of life we share. We appreciate all of you tremendously.  Love, Becca  ",5010,4500,4 days

While the doctors say it is 95% curable, it is going to be a long, difficult and expensive road to get there. She is currently waiting for her PET scan to make sure the cancer has not spread. From there, she will undergo daily radiation treatments, everyday for five weeks, in addition to adding an hour of Chemotherapy one day a week for five weeks, as well as another medication done intervenously three times per week for the same five weeks.  All of her treatments and doctors appointments will be done in Rochester between Highland Hospital and Strong.  During this time, she will be unable to work. Any donations will be used towards gas, tolls, co-pays for appointments, treatments and medication, as well as assisting her in paying her regular bills.  As many of your know, my sister is much like our father and would give the shirt off her back if someone else was in need; so as her sister, I am asking for your help!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/gn652-fighting-stage-4-metastatic-cancer,Fighting Stage 4 Metastatic Cancer,"Sofia Raisanen is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Elvira Guerra Jurado. I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Cancer on May 20th of this year, and it's spread. I am fighting a severe form of cancer where doctor's detected my enlarged liver filled with 8-11 tumors, some measuring 18- 20 cm. After more biopsies, it was brought to my attention that my cancer initially spread from my colon where another tumor was found. Doctor's have already suggested surgery inside of my colon to remove a small tumor, but my Oncologist said that we can't wait six weeks and need to start treatment soon on my liver to reduce the size of these tumors as that's the only option I have. Another ctscan also revealed that my lungs have numerous small nodules, but it's too early to tell if it's cancer. I have a mammogram scheduled in two weeks as my right breast has small lumps. I started chemotherapy June 14th and am on a treatment plan for 6 months to help shrink the tumors inside of my liver so it doesn't fail. I have an evaluation early October so the doctor's can notify me of the chemotherapy and the progress of my tumors. During July I had two separate peritoneal fluid drainages, totaling 4 liters being removed from my stomach, which drastically has now flattened my stomach and provided relief. The reason for fluid build up, ascites, in my abdomen is the cancer pressing up against my liver. This unexpected diagnosis has been very challenging but I will continue to fight to beat the cancer. I lost my unemployment in June and per doctor's requests, I am unable to work. Any help and donations are welcome for medical expenses as I continue to recover. August has been a more optimistic month and after being immobile for nearly two and a half months, I am able to walk again. I am slowly pushing through as I've dropped a ton of weight due to the side effects of chemotherapy. I am grateful for nutrition and have began to gain weight and strengthening my immune system as I become very lethargic. Thanks to the help of medication, I am becoming more mobile. -Sofia ",21913,25000,18-Aug-21

The surgery did not go as well as hoped with only 25% off the tumor removed (the other 75% is too embedded in the motor skills area of her brain). A piece of the tumor was sent to pathology, but we are still waiting for the results. Dakota has had several seizures over the last few days and when she is discharged from the hospital she will undergo several weeks of rehabilitation.  Dakota is 27 years old with a sweet 3-month old baby girl, Kyri Renee. (Dakota and Kyri are pictured above).  Due to her condition, Dakota is unable to work while she recovers.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-coach-willa-fight-cancer,Help Coach Willa Fight Cancer," We’ve all been touched by Cancer – either someone we know or perhaps fighting it ourselves. Besides the devastating emotional impact that hearing that 6-letter word can have, it can also have an equally devastating impact on your finances. Even with insurance, the cost of treatment is prohibitive for many– co-insurance and co-pays can run well into six-figures. Imagine working your entire life, depleting your savings, and still not being able to pay for life-saving medication and treatment. For those of you who don’t know Coach Willa, she is a kind, compassionate and giving woman of faith who has devoted much of her life to helping others less fortunate – a true servant leader. She is an amazing coach, mentor, friend and beloved member of the community. Throughout her corporate career and as an entrepreneur / consultant, Willa has been a champion for under-represented groups, and in particular, women.  Her programs, in particular the Steps2Success series in partnership with Dress for Success Northern NJ-10 Counties, have been life-changing for many women and their families. During the late summer of 2021, our friend and colleague Coach Willa was diagnosed with pneumonia, arrhythmia and metastatic breast cancer. The promising news is that her metastatic breast cancer is currently localized to nearby lymph nodes, the challenge is out-of-pocket treatment cost will approach $75,000 and timing is of the essence. For those who have been touched by cancer, you know this type of diagnosis affects more than just the patient. Her husband Lawrence is retired with his own health challenges and on a fixed income, and Coach Willa’s ability to continue working has been limited due to the illness and treatment regimen. The journey ahead is long and stressful – and we want to help our friend Coach Willa get the life-saving medical treatment she needs without the added stress of worrying about medical bills so she can focus on winning the battle! Please help by giving what you can! All of the money raised will go straight to offsetting medical bills and medications – and you will be making a huge difference in the life of someone who has given so much to many. With God’s grace as well as prayers and good thoughts, she will navigate her way through this detour. Thank you in advance for any donation and prayers. As a reminder, October is breast cancer awareness month – please remember to get your screening!! God Bless! Rita Mitjans & Kim Iozzi ",8315,75000,5 days

Nearly two weeks before celebrating their 47th wedding anniversary, on August 20, 2021 Chuck and Barb took their last walk on the South Haven pier together. Traumatic events unfolded at the end of the pier that impacted all beachgoers that day. Through a random act of gun violence, many people were shot at, but Chuck was fatally shot and called home to heaven. Barb suffered critical injuries and was air-lifted to the hospital. Heroic efforts made by EMTs, police, medical staff and good Samaritans on the pier saved Barb's life. But what lay ahead would be the most difficult journey of grieving, recovery, forgiveness and unknown challenges. Barb has fought the toughest battle so far, and without the love of her life by her side.  But now she needs help that fundraising may provide.  The couple’s retirement was enjoyed when they were together, spending time with their daughters and raising their grandkids, cooking and baking nearly daily and always working on a project.  Witnessing the sudden loss of her husband and dealing with the loss of her independence has permanently altered retirement and the rest of her life.  There’s hope for recovery, but it is not possible without additional intensive reconstructive surgeries and continued restorative therapy. Please consider supporting Barb in the next chapter of recovery so she can continue to be cared for in a safe place and receive the medical therapies needed to improve her quality of life. All monies collected will go towards living in rehabilitation facilities and paying medical expenses throughout the long road ahead.  Your help right now will inspire her and fund the transition out of the hospital to a new rehab environment.  Our family is so grateful for your contribution, and Barb will appreciate any amount you may have to give to help her persevere and overcome this tragic, senseless act of gun violence.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-zach-khalil-beat-a-brain-tumor,Zach Khalil's Brain Tumor Journey,"Brandi Khalil is organizing this fundraiser. Intro Hey All! I'm Brandi Khalil, a 6th grade Math Teacher with VB City Public Schools. My husband, Zach Khalil, has worked for Chesapeake Sheriff’s Office for the past 10+ years as a Deputy Sheriff. Over the past four years he has been an Investigator on the Fugitive Apprehension Unit and is a Task Force Officer with a federal agency helping make the world a safer place. We are both public servants that have given our lives to helping others and supporting our community.We have two children, a 10 year-old daughter and a 17 month-old. On September 1st we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we are expecting our third child in April 2022. Unfortunately, our excitement was short lived when we received a phone call 2 days later. This was the life changing call informing us that Zach has a large brain tumor measuring just under 3cm.  If you know Zach, you’re already aware that he is a light in a dark room. Strives to bring joy to all around him and is never one to bring or see anyone else down. He is always super positive in any given situation, especially in poor ones, where most would lose hope. How did we find this out and what does it mean?While playing with our son, Zach got a pretty good pop to the mouth. This left Zach with a tingling sensation and numbness that eventually spread throughout the whole right side of his face. After a few misdiagnoses and ineffective meds, they ordered an MRI and CT which lead us to that gut wrenching phone call. He has what Dr.‘s believe to be a Vestibular Cochlear Schwannoma (or Acoustic Neuroma) which is typically a benign tumor that is very rare, occurring 1 in 100,000 people. Zach’s is considered large, and is pressing against his facial nerve and brain stem which means - unavoidable surgery.What is our plan moving forward?We did our research and are fortunate enough to have the head of Neurology at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, MD perform the surgery Nov 2, 2021. The stay in MD will consist of: 1 day before for pre-op; a 10-12 hour surgery; 1 day in the ICU; a 5-6 day hospital stay; and 1-2 days staying in Baltimore for observation before beginning the travel home.  Following surgery, 2-3 months of recovery (all cases vary.) Of course any surgery is going to have its costs, even with insurance, especially a 10-12 hour surgery involving multiple surgeons. Because we are going to Johns Hopkins (who is out of network) we will have additional costs incurred, i.e. housing while in MD, travel, daycare, and 2-3 months recovery. Post-surgery will require physical therapy, occupational therapy, acupuncture to stimulate nerve regrowth (to prevent permanent facial paralysis), optometrist and audiologist visits, follow up MRI's/CT scans and JH visits, and unfortunately a hearing implant.As everyone’s recovery is different, we are hoping due to Zach's health, age, and positivity, his recovery will be on the shorter spectrum. Some patients are still not back to regular activity after a year; however, WE are focusing on the short term and want to provide Zach with everything we can to ensure he gets back to where he wants to be as quickly as his body will allow him.Why the GoFundMe?In addition to the above costs mentioned, we also face the lack of time and income that is inevitable. The future is unknown and quite scary. What should be a happy event in April, will now be another lapse in pay and shortened time off. As community service employees, we love our jobs, but they can only do so much when all these events are hitting us in such a short timespan.  According to our neurologist, Zach’s most likely going to lose his hearing in his right ear, making recouping his balance and stamina more difficult. There are a few different implants that can be used to help with hearing loss due to auditory nerve damage. The doctors will evaluate and make their suggestions once his body has healed from the initial surgery. Unfortunately, these are not covered by insurance and costs for surgery alone are $15,000-$17,000, not including the implant itself. Given Zach’s line of work, we want to do whatever we can to help him still be able to decipher which direction sounds are coming from.  This is for his safety, and to better help him protect his community. This would be made possible with these implants.  We had many people offer to start this GoFundMe page for us, but I wanted to tell our story. We understand that a goal of $65,000 is a hefty one, but to be completely honest, we have NO idea what would be a reasonable number to get us through these upcoming events. As we start accumulating bills and talking to the hospital about places to stay near JH, the recovery, the follow up required, the baby, the jobs, the time off…It’s all overwhelming. We understand we are not the only ones experiencing hardships.  We are just asking for your prayers and support during this time and if you are able to donate even a small amount, it all adds up to taking some of the stress away to allow the healing to begin. What's Next? Zach is adamant on starting a video diary to help others dealing with this same life changing predicament. He found a couple on YouTube, one which was Mark Ruffalo's (The Hulk), and he’s watched them numerous times saying how encouraging/informative they are and how they’ve helped him to find peace and a better understanding of what’s to come. We will be recording all parts of this journey so everyone can be updated on Zach’s progress and to enlighten anyone else who is, or has loved ones, going through this same journey.I will be updating on this page to let everyone know how we are coming along, the processes, and how Zach is managing pre- and post-surgery. We love you all and appreciate your help, support, and prayers during these difficult times ahead. ",27264,65000,6-Sep-21

In March of this year, Dave became symptomatic of an illness that,  despite doctor visits, went undiagnosed for far too long. By the time his health reached a critical point, he was finally given a diagnosis of Endocarditis. However, left improperly treated, Dave's body was so full of infection, that his heart valve became damaged, and they were forced to amputate his leg to save his life. Deep in recovery from the amputation, and awaiting Dave to gain enough strength for open heart surgery, Molly was then diagnosed with an aggressive and extremely rare cancer called Cholangiocarcinoma.  Either one of these life changing diagnoses would bring any one of us to our knees, but their true grit is demonstrated every day they fight for their health and family. Molly has continued to work through her chemo treatments and procedures so they may maintain a source of income and insurance, and Dave has continued to work hard on building his strength so that he can be ready for his next major surgery.  Additionally, Molly is traveling to Houston and Oklahoma City for treatment as local doctors were initially unable to treat her.  All of this, while continuing to nurture their two beautiful children.  Expenses, as you can imagine, are stacking up.

Unfortunately, both he and his wife contracted COVID shortly after his retirement. While she has thankfully recovered; Juan has spent the last several weeks in the hospital. He was recently flown to Phoenix, AZ for specialized treatment as his lungs have been severely affected by the virus. He is currently in St. Josephs Hospital and on a ventilator pending more specialized and invasive procedure(s). His retirement plans were abruptly cut short before his pension even fully kicked in. This has caused an unexpected strain on his family both emotionally and financially.

We hope to raise enough to cover their immediate relocation expenses as well as offsetting upcoming medical bills.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/michele-ogutprinces-handicapped-home-renovation,Michele Ogut-Prince’s Handicapped Home Renovation," Hi, my name is Alley and I’m starting this GoFundMe to help with the massive expenses of my mother’s recent CIDP diagnoses and the inability to walk that has come with it.  My mother has been a part of the Highland Mills/Woodbury community since 1979. Most would recognize her as “Missy from Jay’s Deli”, or as Michele Ogut from CSA/Keller Williams Realty. She worked at Jay’s Deli from 1986 to 2014, as was an associate broker from 1998-2019, and to this day still coaches new agents that need a jump start. She also spent time as a Nursing Assistant for Horton Hospital/Orange Regional, as well as a cook at the Orange County Infirmary. She has always been a very generous and loving person, and always does as much as humanly possible to help others. She always goes out of her way to be available when others need her. My mother has always worked multiple jobs to support her kids and family, and give us the best life possible. Now she needs as much help as I can attempt to get her. In April of 2021, my mom received her COVID-19 vaccine in an attempt to protect herself from the virus. Within 2 weeks of the second dose, a rare auto-immune condition was triggered called Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP). This is a RARE neurological disorder that targets her body’s nerves. This left her with numbness and weakness in her whole body, and inability to use her right side. She cannot lift her right leg more than an inch, and struggles to use her right side. It is slowly progressing to her left side, and she has extreme difficulty with basic tasks, and cannot use the stairs to get to the only second floor bathroom. Therefore, the downstairs kitchen must be cut in half so that a handicapped accessible bathroom can be built, so my mother can be at home comfortably, rather than in a facility. She will also need a ramp built at the front door, so she is able to get to physical therapy and doctor’s appointments, which are currently very difficult for her as she has to use the steps and use 2 wheelchairs to do so. I’m asking for help so that my mother is not a prisoner in her own house. Anybody who knows my mother knows how much she’s done for her friends, family, community and even complete strangers. She is a giver in every sense of the word, and desperately needs help in the funding of this bathroom build. (The permit has been granted to build the bathroom/ramp, so as soon as financially able, the building of it will start.) Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, and for helping me get my mother her freedom back. ",4255,12500,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/pat-meyers-battle-with-brain-cancer,Pat Meyer's Battle with brain cancer," Hello,  My name is Greg Carroll and I am helping Pat Meyer, my best friend of 50 years, with the only wish he has that is actually within our control.  This loss of control came quickly and unexpectedly. Pat is currently fighting the battle of his life against brain cancer with the help and support of his wife, Michelle. Unfortunately, but unavoidably, this battle comes with mounting medical expenses and endless trips to doctors and specialists. He wants what any husband would for his wife at a time like this: to ensure that she is able to continue living in the home where they’ve raised their family and built their lives. While we’re still unsure what the outcome of this situation will be, Pat’s hope is that Michelle will be financially able to remain in the place they’ve called home for over 20 years. Knowing his wife and family will be financially secure will allow him to focus all of his energy on beating cancer and getting back home with Michelle.  As long as I have known Pat, he would do anything to help out a friend or family member in their time of need, Pat is now in need of help from his community of family and friends, anything you can spare will be appreciated beyond expression by Pat and Michelle as they navigate this unbelievable situation. How this battle began:                                                                   A few months back, things were getting very stressful for Pat at work. He took some time off and returned to work with a hopeful attitude. Things seemed a little better, but it wasn’t like it had been before. He felt a lot of anxiety and experienced frequent panic attacks. It quickly became clear that he needed professional help to manage this new challenge. Over time, he started taking medicine for anxiety, but it didn’t seem to help much and other issues continued to arise. His personality started changing. He stopped caring what people said, pushing people away, and vomiting due to panic attacks (or so we thought). Things worsened dramatically in the past two weeks. He was expressing no emotion, experiencing dizzy spells and headaches, and had a loss of motor function on the left side of his body. He began having problems with his balance, and fell several times over the weekend. Something else was clearly going on and we quickly decided we needed to get him immediate medical help. They asked a few questions and shortly after, Pat was rushed to the emergency room. They took a CT scan and determined there was a mass in his brain and that would require surgery to have it removed. An MRI was done afterwards to get a better picture of the tumor. Pat’s request at that point was to be transferred to Rochester, but there were no beds available, so we took the last ICU bed here in Mankato. We were very fortunate to have a Mayo-trained doctor available to come and perform his surgery. The surgery was performed yesterday, October 19th, and the surgeon successfully removed about 95% of the tumor, which was 2 inches in diameter. The remaining portion of the tumor was too close to major blood supplies to be removed. ",13725,150000,5 days

Ariel Moya’s Cancer Story;           Hello everyone , on July 1 st we received devastating news that our 4 year old granddaughter was diagnosed with Leukemia. (ALL). She was started on an aggressive chemotherapy treatment. In July her condition became unstable and she was very sick. She was hospitalized for many weeks. In August she did come home and she is receiving her treatments on an outpatient basis but has been hospitalized a few times since then due to complications. She has a feeding tube because she has lost so much weight and doesn’t have an appetite. She is constantly battling vomiting and diarrhea. She is receiving frequent blood and platelet transfusions and bone marrow biopsies and lumbar punctures. She is immunocompromised so she is not free to play outside or with other children except basically her siblings.          In the beginning of this journey Ariel’s was faced with so many challenges she did not understand what was happening to her. After a few months she has become accustomed to her new way of life. She longs to go out and play and get back to her normal life before ALL stole her childhood. Ariel is a free- spirited joyful little girl who loves to play and sing.          We are starting this gofund me page as a fund raiser to help pay for any expenses during this long journey. This treatment plan could last 2-3 years or maybe longer. A few weeks later we received news that she has a rare type of Leukemia that is more difficult to treat and is very complex. We are praying for a miracle. We will not lose hope.             My daughter Lauren (her mother) is a stay at home mom of 4 kids. She is in and out of the hospital with Ariel. My son-in-law Justin, Ariels daddy works in New York and travels back and forth daily. They are both trying to meet the demands of their other 3 children as well as the daily challenges to care for Ariel. Also to be ready at any given time to go back to the hospital as complications occur.            All the grandparents are helping out in any way they can to help keep life stable at home for the other 3 children as well as helping out Justin and Lauren in any way they can with Ariel. Life has been overwhelming and draining for the parents as well as the whole family. We are blessed to have our whole family come together on both Justin’s side and our side to help our children and grandchildren in any way that is needed. We are asking for your help by donating to this fund raiser. We are also asking for your prayers that Ariel continues to have strength to fight. As we watch our sweet angel go through her suffering our hearts are broken. We believe God is fighting this battle and He will provide a miracle.           This is going to be a long difficult journey. We truly appreciate your donation to to help save her young life.           Anything we can do to spread love to this family so they can focus only on their baby girl beating this cancer, is our goal! Please spread the word and thank you so much for any amount you are able to give. God Bless You! Angela ",52000,50000,26-Sep-21

Hello Everyone, First and foremost , I would like thank all of you who have taken the time to read this and hear my Husbands story. I would also like to thank all of those who have been sending their prayers, love, kindness, and support to my family during this time, as well as the entire medical team who have been on my Husbands care. My name is Rosario Carbajal and I come to you with a heavy heart from this nightmare that has become our reality . My husband Robert was in what was suppose to be a mere fender bender. Something many of us would have resolved civilly  by simply exchanging information . However it took a  turn for the worst when the female driving the car turned this into a hit and run. Robert proceeded to follow the vehicle in order to exchange information. When coming to a dead end street, the female appeared to be getting her information and this is where the series of unfortunate events took a drastic turn. The female instead called someone, shortly after, two males showed up. The men attacked my husband, chasing him down, and proceeded to beat him repeatedly before taking his phone, fleeing the scene and leaving my husband for dead . My husband was rushed to the ER where he stays fighting for his life. He suffered multiple fractures to his face, along with swelling and bleeding of the brain. The most heartbreaking of all, is that Robert is the kindest, selfless, and most humble man who is always first to lend a helping hand. He is truly a servant of our Lord who is active in His parish community, and loved by so many. My husband is not a man who is fond of confrontation And it’s difficult to comprehend that someone could be so heartless and cruel to a man who showed no threat. However despite the heartache and difficulties that lie ahead, my husband is a strong faith man who lays all his trust in the hands of our Lord. He knows that he is in Gods hands and with all the prayers that have been embracing our family during this difficult time we are confident that my Husband will heal in Gods time. The road to recovery will be long and challenging, but every small step forward is a mighty blessing of victory. This Gofundme will go towards the medical and rehabilitation expenses of my Husbands road to full health and recovery. A donation of any size is a huge blessing and we are forever grateful. If at all we just continue to ask for your prayers and positive energy sent our way. We cannot begin to express the gratitude and love that we have for you all.  Unfortunately the people responsible for this cruel act are still roaming free. Please be careful out there, and if there is any information you may have to help catch these people and obtain justice for my Husband, please contact the SJPD.

In June, our energetic and beautiful 8 year old daughter, Lucy, was diagnosed with Ewing 's Sarcoma. Ewing's sarcoma is a type of cancerous tumor that forms in bone or soft tissue. Thankfully, we were able to catch this cancer in Lucy at its early stages, as she was experiencing extreme swelling and pain near the tumor area. The doctors are optimistic with her prognosis, but she still has an extensive treatment plan and a long recovery road ahead of her. Lucy will need to undergo many months of chemotherapy, surgery and radiation. We are so lucky to have the best doctors in NJ working on curing her and we cannot wait to celebrate her full recovery when this is over. A little background about our family - Jamie and I are both public servants. I currently serve in the United States Marine Corps and have proudly served our country since 2000.  I was recently promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and have been deployed to several locations during peace and wartime, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Honduras. Most recently I supported the COVID-19 relief effort and hurricane preparedness and assistance in the tri-state area, as well as North Carolina and Louisiana. I have been a Police Officer within the Borough of Ramsey since 2008. My wife Jamie has also dedicated her career to helping children, serving as a kindergarten teacher and reading teacher in Franklin Lakes since 2006.  Prior to this, she served in the Arlington Public Schools in Virginia, teaching English language learners. During this trying and difficult time that our family is experiencing, we have helped and continue to help the community. We are respectfully asking if our family, friends and the public can assist our precious daughter in her fight against Ewing's Sarcoma. Medical bills are accumulating rapidly and any assistance would be very much appreciated by our family. Words cannot express our gratitude for any help we receive. Thank you so much. Please also keep Lucy in your prayers! For any further information, you can reach out to the Ramsey PBA Local 155 via email: [email redacted] ",68910,95000,17-Aug-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-amanda-fight-her-cancer-battle,Help Amanda Fight her Cancer Battle," Hi, my names Amanda McKillip Miller. About a month ago on Sept 9th I went into the ER with severe rectal and vaginal pain from not being able to pass a bowel movement days prior and then started to uncontrollably go but with severe pain. Upon protocol I had bloodwork, a urine test and a CT scan done. Not ever thinking as I sat alone in the ER waiting room for the results that afternoon that the CT would come back with rectal wall thickening and malignancy possible . Upon entry I was admitted into Hershey Medical Center by the Colorectal surgery team on Sept 10th and would undergo a colonoscopy and possible mass removal or biopsy in the OR the next day on Sept 11th. Going into the OR that next day l was obviously thinking this mass would be able to be removed and would have good news once I was in recovery. Unfortunately my surgeon was unable to remove the mass and could only take biopsies which would take up to 10 days for pathology to come back because he was sure it was cancer. I underwent CT's of my pelvis/abdomen and chest for staging purposes and also an MRI as well. I was discharged pending my results with a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. Fast forward a few days on 9/15/21 I got the phone call no one wants to hear that my results were back from pathology. The day after my 36th birthday on 9/15/21 I was diagnosed with Stage 4 Anal Cancer. It not only was Anal cancer but it's Stage 4 because it spread to a vaginal lymph node. My heart hit floor, I felt like my life was shattered into a million pieces. I felt that I was being punished for something and after losing my Dad last year wasn't enough now I have cancer. But yet again, my Dr. explained that surgery is not an option at this point as if I were to remove the mass I would end up with a colostomy bag for the rest of my life. He said that chemotherapy infusion and radiation is my only option to cure this as of right now. Which my prognosis for treatment is good, and worst case scenario after 6 weeks of treatment I could end up having more treatment or surgery to remove the rest of the tumor and have a colostomy placed permanently but that is what will be if that time comes. After receiving this devastating news the next morning l woke up with severe vaginal pain and pressure, started throwing up and running a high fever. Rushing myself to the ER once again l was admitted for the second time a week later this time was from the tumor itself it had created a vaginal abscess making me very sick. I ended up being there from 9/16-9/20 masking the pain with pain medicine so they could get this infection under control with antibiotics and to get me better so I could make it to meet with my chemo and radiation Drs. that coming week so I could start my treatment process plan and have the tests done and images done prior to my 6 week treatment. This whole cycle has been one very emotionally and physically draining month for me and my family. I had issues with my insurance company not covering Hershey for my treatment, but went through an appeal process on which my Dr. had to speak on my behalf to the director of the insurance company explaining the seriousness of my cancer and that I need to be treated as soon as possible so this doesn't get any worse. Which I won the appeal so I could have my care continue on as it should. I've been off work since 9/16/21 and will be off for some time as I started my 6 week treatment of 28 radiation sessions, and 2 weeks of chemotherapy 10/11/21. Which as of today 10/22/21 I'm already 2 weeks in and I'm doing ok so far but it's rough physically and emotionally. Afterwards l will be undergoing surgery to have a complete hysterectomy because it's spread to my vaginal lymph node and they don't want to take any chances of the cancer cells being somewhere in my reproductive system and it possibly spreading more. Prayer has been on my side up until this point and continuously still. But creating this GoFundMe is a lot for me personally. My friend Rachel who created this for me, let me write my story and explain what exactly I have gone through and currently am going through. I'm not a person to ask for help unless I absolutely need to. But with being off work and only getting so much from Short Term Disability and the savings I have it won't even come close to being able to handle medical expenses that I have coming my way for the 2 hospital stays that I have EOBs being processed for currently, followed by bills coming my way for Dr. visits, my 6 weeks treatment with radiation and chemotherapy with hopeful results after and a hysterectomy surgery along with recovery time as well from all of this . Being a single Mom supporting my daughter and l on a daily basis this unexpected diagnosis has put a huge financial burden in the works already and it's already starting to become overwhelming. I've had the generosity of a friend who set up a meal train 2 times a week through church where they've been delivering us meals for dinner and it's been very helpful to alleviate stress on that end of cooking everyday etc. since I started treatment. Personally, I don't want people to think I'm a charity case and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. It's something I'd never wish upon anybody but asking for help has been told me to by numerous people that I shouldn't be ashamed to ask for financially. Prayers to God and my Guardian angel my Dad watching over me in heaven have gotten me so far to stay strong for my daughter and for my family and friends that have been aware of this situation. My Mother has been a big help with taking FMLA leave and still working to get me to and from radiation at the cancer institute everyday. I'm very thankful for all the help I've had so far. But with the upcoming expenses I have coming in already and surgeries I will have I appreciate anything that you'd be willing to help me with. I am a true believer in prayer and I have come so far already through this battle that has just begun for me. Thank you for your time and consideration in this matter. Gods Speed!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-medical-expenses-for-riley-cinra-xiong,Help with Medical Expenses for Riley CiNra Xiong," Hello Friends & Family, On October 8th, 2021 at 4am, our first, beautiful, and precious daughter Riley Ci Nra Xiong was born. She weighs 6lbs 1.4oz. When she arrived in this world she had complications with her oxygen levels and was immediately transferred to the NICU at U of M Masonic Children's Hospital. Riley had heart failure at birth requiring ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) support for her heart and lungs. The doctors are not sure why she has heart failure but suspect it could be due to an infection or underlying problem with her heart muscle. Her heart function has moderately improved while on ECMO, but her doctors and we are concerned that she will continue to need extra heart support even after disconnecting from the ECMO machine. This is because her left heart muscle is not squeezing normally and she has mitral regurgitation, which is when some of the blood flows backwards toward the lungs when her heart squeezes instead out to her body. This mitral regurgitation makes the heart work harder and we worry that her heart will tire out and need extra support. Her doctors estimate that there is a greater than 50% chance that her heart will need additional assistance. This is difficult to determine until she is disconnected from the ECMO. The support that she could need is called a ventricular assist device, or VAD, with the ultimate goal of her getting a new heart via heart transplant. This would require her transferring to a different institution where they place the assist devices and perform heart transplants. She would need to be evaluated by the outside institution and they would determine whether she is a good candidate for the assist device and transplant. They may determine she is not eligible because of her complicated course, especially the bleeding in her brain. If she was accepted, she would need to remain hospitalized in that hospital for her ventricular assist device placement and recovery, and then would need to wait until a heart was available that is a good fit. After her transplant, she would likely need to stay locally for several months up to a year in order to attend frequent follow-up appointments. These are very complex decisions for us as a family to make but we trust the doctors are doing what is best for our daughter. Because of this, we're asking for help for any amount of donations that will go towards her medical and traveling expenses (should she be transferred out of state). Any amount is appreciated during this hard time for us. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Ker, KB, & Riley Xiong ",14985,25000,21-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-holloways,Help the Holloways," So by now most of you have heard the horrible news of our house burning down. It happened on Saturday 10/16/21 at 2am. Thankfully my dad and his dog Boden made it out with some minor cuts and bruises. But, unfortunately, my parents have lost everything else. Which leads me to why I’m starting this go fund me page. Usually the mindset in my family is “put your big girl pants on and suck it up butter cup.” But honestly I feel my parents have had way too much dealt their way lately. My mom (superwoman) has been working 7 days a week nonstop since November 15th 2019, with taking care of my dad plus all the bills that come in. Most of you know my dad is still recovering from being shot in a hunting accident that took place on November 15, 2019. He has been in and out of multiple surgeries plus physical therapy to repair/rebuild his median nerve. So while my mom has been working nonstop and my dad is finding his way dealing with his limitations, my parents decided to rent the house out. Then when things were finally looking up for my parents, the huge house fire occurred….with no insurance (thanks to hurricane Michael.)  It was an electrical fire that started in the attic and just spread extremely quickly and nothing could be saved… I always remember my parents saying “Don’t lie, cheat or steal. Because if you need something that bad all you need to do is ask because there is always someone who is willing to help.” So I’m asking , because I know my parents need all the help they can get. So if you are one of these people willing to help we would greatly appreciate it. Whether it’s donations of non-perishables, money, clothes, time or prayers, it would mean more to my family than you know. All the money we raise will go towards rebuilding their lives and reestablishing their home. THANKYOU so much for taking the time to read this and all the support and prayers that have already come our way♥️. ( My dad is a size 32-33 in pants & shorts, and a large in shirts. Shoe size is an 11. My mom thankfully we have covered in clothes and shoes because she’s the same size as my sister and I.) ",9350,10000,7 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-lauren-mitch-baby-james,"Support for Lauren, Mitch & Baby James"," Lauren and Mitch were expecting their first child on October 30. On October 25, however, Lauren suffered a pulmonary embolism which caused her to go into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital. ER doctors performed an emergency c-section, worked to clear the blood clot that caused her cardiac arrest, and then worked to stabilize her heart and lungs. She underwent many surgeries over the past few days, but ultimately Lauren's brain was catastrophically damaged from a lack of oxygen, and Lauren never woke up.As for the baby, doctors were concerned that he also suffered significant brain damage.However, in what they described as a miracle, we learned yesterday that his brain is completely undamaged and he is expected to live a normal life. So, it is with great joy that we introduce James Rolland Graff-Ness.It is safe to say that every minute Lauren fought against her own cardiac arrest contributed to saving James' life. For that, we are forever grateful. It is a cruel price she had to pay, but ultimately she did her best to ensure that her baby was safe, and we are certain that everyone agrees that the toughness she demonstrated in that moment perfectly encapsulates Lauren in every other aspect of her life. This was a completely unexpected and devastating tragedy, and we hope to collect funds to help Mitch and James rebuild and move forward. With funeral costs, potential relocation fees, and childcare needs, your donations will help support this wonderful and deserving family during an impossibly difficult time. ",11275,10000,10 hours

Martha and I have been friends since we were infants. She is a wonderful mom to her four children, whom she has raised on her own. She has spent her entire adult life dedicating all her free time an energy to support them with school, sports, and extra-curricular activities. Just before Christmas in 2020, Martha noticed something unusual and immediately called her doctor. In January of 2021 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and in the 2 months that followed, she had numerous appointments with oncologists, as well as surgery to remove a malignant mass and a couple lymph nodes. She began chemotherapy treatments at the end of May and continued with radiation therapy until recently. During the last 5 months, we saw her endure the most painful side effects as a result of the therapies. Yet, she has always found a way to stay positive and has been determined to beat cancer. Through the pain, she managed to get herself out of bed to attend her daughter's performances or her son's baseball games. She is a warrior at heart! As she was nearing the end of radiation treatments ,the unexpected happened. Martha and her two youngest, 10 and 17 years old, contracted COVID-19. Due to chemo, she has a very low immune system and COVID-19 symptoms quickly worsened. Last night, just after 1:00 a.m., Martha's daughters rushed her to the hospital and she is not doing well. She is currently on oxygen treatments and doctors expect a long hospital stay. Many friends have asked what you can do to help Martha. She and her children need our support the most during this time. Thankfully, they have food, but will need financial help for rent, utilities, and gas, or travel expenses. If you feel inclined and are able to help with any amount, no matter how big or how small, I know Martha and her children will be most grateful. Anyone who knows Martha knows that she has an infectious laugh that will bring you to tears. We yearn to hear that laughter once again! Please keep Martha and her children in your prayers.

She's been a dear friend of mine for 25 years, and she's one of the most kind and positive people I know. She's so full of love and light, always finds the silver lining amidst thunderstorms. Samiah is an incredibly talented artist who started her own business 20+ years ago and built it from the ground up. Almost a year ago, she and her husband and son packed up their entire world and left behind everything they know and love, to move out of state in pursuit of their dream to buy a home. Shortly after arriving, with no family, friends or support system nearby, Samiah was diagnosed with an aggressive and fast growing form of brain cancer. (glioblastoma multiforme) She had been suffering with some symptoms for awhile before they moved, but no one suspected or checked for a brain tumor. Shortly after moving, her neck and head pain became so severe, she went to the ER and the tumor was discovered. They sent her home that night, and three days later she had brain surgery to remove the tumor. This was Dec. 2020. She started chemo and radiation the following month, and the treatments took a significant toll on her body. She spent months post-treatment, trying to heal her body naturally and recover her energy. She sleeps and rests a lot. She's a wife and mom, and as you can imagine, this horrible disease has robbed their beautiful family of time...precious time together to explore and enjoy their beautiful new surroundings. She hasn't been able to work, so her beloved business that she's poured her heart and soul into building over the past 20 years, has been sitting stagnant not providing them with much needed income. Insurance never covers all the medical bills associated with cancer treatments, and they now live in a very remote area, with a two-hour drive each way to the closest big city where the hospital is located. A few months ago, Samiah returned to CA by herself, to begin an experimental treatment, which is expensive. The tumor grew back and surgery is no longer an option. Her husband and son fly back and forth to be here with her as much as possible, while she stays with extended family. Insurance does not cover costs for this treatment, and her wonderful family members have been providing as much financial support for the treatment as possible. Samiah needs our help in order to afford continuing treatments. Samiah would truly appreciate any help you feel compelled to give, and she thanks you from the bottom of her heart! We're praying for a beautiful miracle for our sweet Samiah!!  To know her truly is to love her.  ",10700,10000,19-Oct-21

On Wednesday, October 20, 2021, Regi was in a horrific car accident on her way home from work. She sustained multiple severe injuries in the crash and was airlifted to Albany Medical for treatment and emergency surgery. She luckily avoided brain injuries and paralysis. However, she has several broken bones, including a broken jaw and cracked vertebrae, countless lacerations and bruises, as well as other internal injuries that required surgery. She is now stable, but her injuries are numerous and will take a great deal of time to heal. Regi is a manager at Lost Dog Café in Binghamton, NY. She has a small family that she helps support. She and her boyfriend, Nick, are raising a 3-year-old son named Kason. Unfortunately, her injuries will take several months to heal and will result in lost work and income. Her family would like to help alleviate some of the financial burden by raising funds to cover her monthly bills, such as rent, utilities, and groceries for her family of 3. In addition,  Nick now has travel and childcare costs as he visits Albany to be by Regi's side. Regi will also need to see dental and medical specialists as part of her healing journey and will need those medical expenses covered.  We would love for Regi to be able to heal peacefully without having the extra worry about finances during this difficult time. Any donations are welcomed and greatly appreciated!

All funds raised here will go directly toward the care that Declan needs.  Read Declan's story from his parents below: Please pray for Declan With aching hearts we ask for prayer for our beloved baby as he embarks on a fight against cancer. Declan was born with a small bump on his back which appeared to be a hemangioma or “strawberry mark”. It grew quickly in his first few months and eventually we were recommended to have it removed, which we did a month ago. After his surgery, we received the devastating news that the tumor they removed was not benign, but was a phenomenally rare form of cancer. Several head-spinning days followed while we were referred to a Pediatric Oncologist and sought additional testing in hopes that this was an isolated event. However, before our initial appointments even took place, Declan developed a swollen lump on his left temple, which has now been confirmed as a second cancerous tumor. Today, Declan’s specific type of cancer is still being determined. In the meantime, our sweet 6 month old is starting chemo & we ask for your prayers. Please share this link, mention Declan at your church, add our little one to your prayer chain. The only thing we can do as Declan’s parents is to enlist as many people as possible to pray for our son. Please help us by sharing Declan’s story with every praying person you know. “I trace the rainbow through the rain, and feel the promise is not vain: that morn shall tearless be!” -O Love That Will Not Let Me Go For daily updates & prayer requests, sign up for email or text notifications on Declan’s Caring Bridge.

Most of it was removed when it was 1st discovered 5 years ago. Unfortunately, part of it is inoperable. She has already had chemo and other experimental treatment since the 1st surgery. She has had a 2nd surgery too. The tumor has now grown and advanced more and requires further more serious action including a 3rd surgery, radiation and more aggressive chemotherapy. This is urgent and this new round of activity has already begun. The tumor isn't like others that can be removed with only surgery like a single mass. This tumor is infiltrative which means it spreads like tentacles. It is also right in the middle of her brain on the meridian between the left and right hemispheres. It is also deeply embedded. This makes it particularly dangerous and difficult to treat. As you can see in the picture, Annie is beautiful. She is beautiful in every sense of the word. All she wanted is to have her own babies naturally and was hopeful prior treatments would take care of the tumor so she could live a normal life. Now she is in survival mode. It is very hard to take and I'm calling on all friends, neighbors, relatives, fellow church members, co-workers to lend your support. Annie and her husband Dom have already exhausted their funds and we're not sure how much insurance will continue to cover. It is heartbreaking. She hasn't given up herself either. In fact, in the year after her 1st surgery she went on earn her master's degree in special education and has been teaching special ed ever since. She is the the living testimony to the resiliency of the human spirit. And she has the best husband a father could ask for. He's been carrying quite a load on his young shoulders and I couldn't be more proud. This whole experience began right after they got married. The picture is on her and Dom's wedding day and those are six of her little nieces. Please help Annie and Dom squeeze more out of this beautiful gift of life and their young marriage. They and all of us could use as much support as you can give both materially and spiritually in your heartfelt prayers. Thank you and God bless you and your family and friends.

As most of us know, a cancer diagnosis can be traumatic. When it happens to your child, it's doubly scary, and when it happens to a family that has already had more than its share of cancer, it just feels unfair and insurmountable. But luckily those of us that know the Bengtsons know just how resilient and strong they are, and how many of us are going to fight alongside with them. While Kris is still waiting to be declared ""cancer free"" himself, on Tuesday, October 12, his 5 year old daughter,  Julia, was diagnosed with Leukemia. Kris and Dana both work as teachers, and since Julia will need round the clock care and a parent with her at all times during this battle, they will be living on a single income for the time being. Add to that medical bills, transportation costs to and from UNC, and other unforeseen expenses, and we are asking that you donate anything you can to help them through this period in their lives. Luckily, between medical advancements and living in the best place in the country for cutting-edge cancer treatments, the prognosis for Julia is fairly positive. But for the next two years, this family's life will be uprooted once again as Julia receives treatment and attends school at the Children's Hospital in Chapel Hill, since her immune system will be unable to tolerate attending her public school. In just three days, she has faced surgery, met her new teacher, had bone marrow harvested, and lived in a hospital away from home, yet is still the smiling and vibrant little girl we all love so much. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers as she battles this disease. Anything you contribute will go directly to helping Kris and Dana support their family and pay Julia's medical bills.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jr-getches-fight-angiosarcoma,Help JR Getches Fight Angiosarcoma,"Team fundraiserCyndi Goetcheus Sarfan and 2 others are organizing this fundraiser. Our wonderful brother JR Getches has always been one in a million, a bright shining star in so many people’s lives. But unfortunately, JR has recently been diagnosed with a very rare cancer, one that literally affects only one in a million people every year in the United States. It is called Epithelial Angiosarcoma. JR is now in the fight of his life to beat this terrible disease. JR’s family members are starting this GoFundMe to help him with that fight in every way we can. We want to ease the daily and monthly financial burdens for him and his wife Christina so that they can both focus on doing everything imaginable to restore JR to full health as quickly as possible. This includes paying as many of their basic living expenses as we can in case he is no longer able to keep his current job. Hopefully, JR will soon be accepted into a clinical trial in Denver, which will mean continual travel expenses from their home in Pueblo for as long as the treatment takes. Obviously, there will also be unknown medical expenses that will need to be covered. Please help us help JR focus on getting well by donating today! All donations large or small are greatly appreciated.   #teamJR, #getchesstrong Cyndi, Scott and Susan ",21948,100000,18-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/step-by-step-to-curts-healing,Step by step to Curt's Healing," Hello, On September 3rd, Curt (dad) and I were attending the Lee Brice concert in West Salem, WI. We had the best night enjoying the music and time together. We had walked to the concert that night, as my aunt and uncle live just a couple blocks away from where the concert was located. As we made our way home, my dad was struck by a car while crossing the highway. With my dad being from Racine (4 hours from where the accident happened), I quickly had to make a decision on where his care was going to happen. Throughout the next few LONG days, my dads trauma team continued to update us on the seriousness of his injuries. The damage on the right side of dad's body is quite extensive. Dad had a broken fibula, multi-fractured pelvis, a punctured lung, multiple broken bones in the mid section including ribs, sternum, and clavicle, his shoulder was dislocated, and he had LOTS of stitches and staples scattered around his body. Among all these other injuries, we were told that dad's neck was broke in 3 different locations, obviously being the most concerning issue. The days following the accident were filled will coming up with the best possible treatment plan. It was determined that dad's pelvis was going to need surgery, as it was a pretty complicated break. The surgeons decided that operating on dad's neck was not an option. So after a long week of laying COMPLETELY flat on his back (he was cracking us up this whole time on ideas he was coming up with on how to keep his neck and pelvis stable while being able to move the bed upright), dad had his surgeries. A halo was placed for his neck and his pelvis was repaired. After dad had gained enough strength throughout the weeks he had been in the hospital, he was able to be moved to the rehabilitation unit of the hospital. He went through two weeks of vigorous therapy in order to prepare him for home. After 26 days in the hospital, dad was finally able to go home. Fast forward to now, almost 8 weeks since the accident, dad is ROCKING this recovery process. He is still non-weight bearing on his leg because of the pelvis. His halo will be on for quite a while still as the bones in his neck continue to heal. The other broken bones are healing as the days go on. With every day, dad is building his strength and finding new ways to do things for himself. Getting in and out of a car is nearly impossible with the size of his halo, so much of his care is happening at his home. We would not be where we are today without the wonderful medical staff that have been along this journey with us. There are countless first responders, CNAs, nurses, doctors, OR staff, rehabilitation staff and many many more that we are eternally grateful for. Dad has a LONG ways to go on his journey to recovery. The financial burden has been weighing on him since the beginning. It is a big unknown as to when dad will be able to work again. There will undoubtedly be ongoing medical bills and expenses in order to give dad the best care possible in order to get him back on his feet. Anything to help offset any costs is extremely appreciated. My goal is to help ease dad's mind and help him focus on the things needed in order to get him healed. We are so thankful for all the love and support that we have been given throughout this difficult time. Prayers are greatly appreciated as we continue to navigate the healing process. With love, Curt's daughter, Ashley ",1970,5000,3 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/8a2m9-help-my-dad-get-a-liver,Help My Dad Get A Liver Transplant," Hello family and friends, My name is Shannon and I am setting up this fundraiser on behalf of my father, Michael. My dad is currently suffering from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and needs a liver transplant before he gets worse. My brother, Connor, has selflessly volunteered to donate approximately 60% of his liver to help save our dad. Unfortunately, this living-donor liver transplantation is not offered close to our home in Arizona and we will be required to spend a few months in Los Angeles, California. My dad is a loving husband, father, son, uncle, brother, and friend. He was a volunteer firefighter and police officer before suffering an injury that persists to this day. He took medications to help alleviate his chronic pain, which ultimately led to his liver failure. It has been so long since he was able to enjoy his life and has been devastating to watch. He has spent several months in the hospital within the last few years because of the stress on his body. We are hoping that this surgery will help restore his quality of life. My dad's pride keeps him from requesting any help so I will. He spent a majority of his life helping others and now it is time that he receives help himself as well. I am hoping to raise funds to help defray any expenses related to the surgery and recovery process. In addition, my brother will be required to step away from his job while he recovers. My family and I appreciate any support, whether it is through a donation, sharing our story, or sending positive thoughts. Thank you for taking the time to read this and support my family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-janelle-with-medical-expenses,Help Janelle with Medical Expenses," Hello my name is Jennifer and that beautiful lady in the picture is my sister, Janelle. She is a teacher at The Salon Professional Academy in Dallas, Texas. This year has been tough as she was diagnosed with FSGS. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a disease in which scar tissue develops on the parts of the kidneys that filter waste from the blood (glomeruli). She is in End stage renal failure. Then she was diagnosed with postulate psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis is a rare and severe form of psoriasis that involves widespread inflammation of the skin and small white or yellow pus-filled blisters or pustules. The pus consists of white blood cells and is not a sign of infection. This is on top of the Crohns that she has lived with for years. She was trying to get better and get to the correct doctors (that her insurance would allow), and then 26 days ago she was diagnosed with Covid and was hospitalized where she spent 21 days sedated on a ventilator in ICU. She is awake now and on the mend, but she needs to transfer to a long term care facility that her insurance is currently denying. She needs this transfer so she can rehab as Covid did harm her body and she has to learn how to function with the permanent changes to her body and her systems. This is while still needing dialysis 3 times a week. Janelle is not married, and both of our parents have passed. If I could afford to pay her medical bills I would but I cannot. Her insurance helps but there is still a lot that she owes and will owe. Janelle is an amazing person who will do anything to help others and she needs help now. She was named educator of the year last year and loves her Camero, Elvira. The cover photo is Janelle before disease took over. She is vibrant, funny, and loved! I know we all have expenses but please consider donating to help, any amount is greatly appreciated. The picture below was taken the first day she was awake on October 23, 2021. ",3095,100000,5 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-adriana-fight-with-cancer,Help Adriana's fight with Cancer," For those that have spent time with Adriana know that ever since she was a young girl, she would always be taking care of others. She is the eldest of 5 siblings therefore she was always looking out for her brothers and sisters. She is a hard-working woman, mother of 2, and wife.  A few years ago, Adriana was in a terrible bus accident. Ever since that accident, the doctors told her she had sciatic neuritis. In July 2021, she traveled to Ecuador with her daughters and mom. During her stay, Adriana was in constant pain and had trouble walking and sleeping because the sciatic pain was unbearable. A few weeks later, her mom was admitted to the hospital for cirrhosis in her lungs and lung cancer. This was extremely difficult for Adriana to see her poor mom suffering in such a helpless condition. Since Adriana had to return to work to provide for her household, she traveled back home to NY in August. She was so upset to leave her mom in that condition, but she knew she had no choice or else she would lose her job.  As a school bus driver, Adriana’s employer required routine doctor checkups to ensure that she was in good condition to take care of the children and ensure their safety. When she had her doctor’s visits, they never detected any other health problems other than the sciatic neuritis.  Back in Ecuador, her mom’s condition had progressed so much that the doctors gave very little hope. Desperate to see her mother, Adriana flew back to Ecuador to be with her mom while struggling with her own health problems. After battling for her life in the hospital for 3 weeks, Adriana’s mom passed away on August 30th.  Adriana had a difficult time coping with this terrible loss. She wanted to return home to be with her daughters and husband but after seeing a doctor in Ecuador, he advised her to stay longer in Ecuador because traveling back to the United States in her condition would be a risk for her life. Adriana visited her doctor daily however they only gave her medicine for her pain for the sciatic neuritis. Two weeks later she returned home however she was in no condition to return to work. Most nights Adriana couldn’t sleep but one night it got really bad that she couldn’t sleep, she would cry because of the unbearable pain and couldn’t feel her legs. Her husband immediately rushed her to the hospital where they did a lot of tests and scans to see what the problem was. They had found that Adriana had water around her heart and blood clots. The doctors had to immediately perform an open heart surgery in order to get rid of this water. It was very difficult for Adriana to deal with all of this at the same time and she felt so helpless.  A few days later, Adriana was recovering from her heart surgery and the doctors still had to perform a lot of tests and this time they did X-rays and biopsies to see how she was doing. This was when she received the heart-breaking news that she has been diagnosed with lung cancer. When Adriana received the news, she was alone, Adriana was devastated and didn’t know what her life would be like moving forward. She had gone through so much and she was in disbelief that she was going through all of this.  Adriana is still in the hospital as of today and her pain worsens each day. Unfortunately, every day is a challenge and starting next week, she will undergo radiation therapy every day.  This is a very difficult time for her since she had always been used to being active at work and her household, now she is laying in this hospital bed desperate and not able to return home to be with her family. Adriana’s daughters and husband feel so heartbroken seeing here in this condition. As a final note, Adriana and her family have been and are still experiencing difficult times. With her mom that recently passed away, her heart surgery, and now being diagnosed with cancer, we would like to ask for those that are able to, to please make any donation. No amount is too small, we would be eternally grateful with all that have helped. There is no doubt that undergoing these surgeries and treatments are very expensive but there are personal expenses as well. With your donations, we would make Adriana and her family have one less thing to worry about. All we can hope is for Adriana to recover from this difficult situation and be able to be with her family again. Thank you for reading Adriana’s story. God bless you ",6470,20000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/peters-road-to-healing-recovery,Peter Lanting’s Road to Healing & Restoration✨," We decided to create this go fund me account (All funds will go directly to Peter and his wife Suzanne) to provide some financial assistance to make sure Peter receives the best treatments and care for his long and intensive recovery ahead. Late evening of his daughter’s 10th birthday on Aug. 13th, he had been feeling a bit out of his element. Morning came and he was feeling run down, a bit of a cough and some body aches. Symptoms slowly worsened as days passed and on Aug. 21st, he finally decided to get admitted to the ER as he felt extremely weak and out of breath with oxygen levels in the 70s and testing positive for Covid19. Things were actually improving in the hospital and he had been looking forward to joining the family for their DisneyWorld trip that they have been planning for months thinking he and Suzanne could just push their flights back a few days and meet them. Unfortunately, that didn’t happen. In the early morning of Sept. 7th, things had turned for the worse. He was placed in an induced coma, paralyzed and intubated. It’s crazy to imagine how much he has gone through; pneumonia, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, bacterial infections, congestive heart failure, awful withdrawals from narcotics and so much more!!!!  He has had several close calls but as strong as Peter is, he fought and continues to fight every single day! After 42 days in the ICU (total of 58 days in the hospital as of 10/19/21), he has been downgraded to the Telemetry unit (his heart & lungs still needs to be monitored) several days ago.  Drs says he has a very, very long road to recovery considering everything he’s been through, with lung & heart damage and being bed ridden for so long. He is currently on full support meaning they will do everything to save him shall anything unexpected was to occur. He is still currently on the ventilator via a tracheotomy and they are slowly working on weaning him off it. It’s been a grueling roller coaster and absolutely heart breaking seeing him go through such challenging times as anyone can imagine but we have never lost faith! It’s crazy to think how such events can happen to such a perfect person. If you know Peter, he is a true fighter! So full of life, being a workout freak & physically active on a daily basis and healthy! He has the biggest heart and always enjoys helping everyone he meets. He’s so unselfish, loving, has great sense of humor, polite, humble and a very likable guy! For many years, has been contributing to our community with his knowledge and passion for health, fitness and just life itself!  Your continued positive thoughts, prayers, chants, healing energies are forever appreciated.  We all want him back home soon to his beautiful children, grandkids, wife, family & friends where he belongs!   We would also like to thank you for continuing to support Hardcore 808 Nutrition Co. We know you miss seeing him at work but in due time, he will be back! We will keep you all updated here each week as much as possible on his progress.  Much love and gratitude to you all from the bottom of our hearts.

Well, right now our very own Mayor of Munchkinville is in need of our support.In May 2021, our mom Karen Sahler was unfortunately diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. The fight has been an ever changing battle, having to face new obstacles and challenges with each phase of treatment. She just underwent her 4th round of chemo and will have a follow up PET scan in two weeks to find out if this treatment is working, or if they have to take a different route. We are optimistic and hopeful that it’s working! If it is working, she should only need a few more rounds of chemo, however, there is another type of medication that she will need to receive through an IV for at least a year following treatment. Unfortunately, she is dealing with another battle which is her insurance. Having a high deductible plan that really isn’t covering much of her treatment once the deductible had been met, she is faced with high medical bills and no end in sight. We have always been the family to give when those are in need, and we are asking for any support that you may be able to provide in return. We know that many of you just helped support our family through Chelsea’s battle with cancer a year ago, and we are extremely grateful for all the love and generosity that you have already shown our family. If you have the ability, in any way, to support our mom and dad through this difficult time, we will be forever appreciative.  If you aren’t able to provide any financial assistance, your prayers and thoughts of healing are equally appreciated ❤️ We love you, mom! ",13610,20000,21-Oct-21

Friends, we truly hate to do this but Fern and I need help. My strong and stubborn wife’s recurrent glioblastoma has progressed to the point where she is on a cocktail of experimental drugs and the costs of treatment and life are beginning to weigh on us. I feel like it’s time for me to take medical leave from work, but since we have been a single income family for almost two years that’s not entirely feasible without financial help. Here’s what she has been through: 4 brain surgeries, including the placement of a permanent shunt to drain fluid from her brain Countless rounds of chemotherapy 3 separate times she has received the maximum amount of radiation one can tolerate in a lifetime Ongoing biweekly immunotherapy via an IV Almost every anti-seizure medication on the market, including one that cost $1200/month Physical therapy, occupational therapy, accessibility modifications to our home, and eventually, very much reluctantly, a wheelchair It has been 7 years since her initial diagnosis and if you’ve been following along, you already know she’s an absolute badass. Many of you know her dear sister, Cate, was diagnosed with another type of brain cancer over the summer and is undergoing treatment right now as well. This presents a whole new set of challenges for the family at the same time we are encountering increased difficulty in Fern’s mobility and treatment options. We are beginning to explore options for in-home care as the stresses of everyday life stack up. So your contribution will help me utilize FMLA and spend more time with my wife, help ease the financial toll of the costs of treatment already incurred, and allow us to hire professional help around the home so Fern’s family and I can get a much needed respite. I hate this and I appreciate you. ",61893,5000,15-Oct-21

Hello everyone, on the pictures here are these two little angels just 9 years old twins Emilija and Elena along with their amazing parents. On July 26th 2021, after 4 days of fever, out of nowhere Emilija while sitting in their room with her twin sister had epileptic seizure, she was rushed to local hospital in Strumica, Macedonia from where urgently was transported to University Children's Hospital in Skopje. There she was diagnosed with viral encephalitis , caused by West Nile Virus from mosquito bite. Due to fast and progressive deterioration of her medical condition she was transferred into intensive care and had to be put into medical induced coma. After little over a month into intensive care her condition was stabilized but she remained to be with altered consciousness, with no visual contact, unable to swallow and feed her self, loss speech and movement. Doctors in Macedonia recommended that she urgently needs neurological rehabilitation treatment, intensive occupational therapy, intensive physical therapy and rehabilitation in centers specialized for patients in such a condition, which are not available in Macedonia. They did recommend to look for such a hospitals in Turkey, Slovenia or Germany. Few hospitals denied to accept her either because of the condition she is or due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Two days ago she was transported in Acibadem Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey and is currently ongoing exams so the doctors there can provide a answer with their final decision if her recovery can continue there and what the cost will be, in the mean team we received answer from Hegau-Jugendwerk Kids Hospital in Germany that they would be able to accept the patient if her treatment cannot be continued or successfully finished in Istanbul, Turkey and the cost will be 60 200 euros (70 000 USD) on top the costs of 5000 euros already spent to be transported to Istanbul with ambulance, and whatever the additional cost will be if she needed to be transported to Germany as well. All these medical bills can put at huge burden and scrutiny on any family these days, and none can be prepared for such a thing, and as can be seen, hospital are asking for full amount to be paid in advance, and while the decision is awaited from Adjibadem in Istanbul, on behalf of Emilija, and her parents, my self along with all of their relatives and friends decided to start this campaign to help with this financial burden, and we all together help to BRING THE SMILE BACK on Emilija's face, and to make her twin sister Elena whole again and all the happiness to be back in their family!

На 26 јули 2021 година, по 4 дневна настинка, додека Емилија седеше во нивната соба со нејзината сестра близначка имаше епилептичен напад, итно беше пренесена во локалната болница во Струмица, Македонија од каде итно беше пренесена во Универзитетската детска болница во Скопје. Таму и беше дијагностициран вирусен енцефалитис, предизвикан од вирусот Западно Нилска треска од каснување од комарец. Поради брзо и прогресивно влошување на нејзината здравствена состојба, таа беше префрлена на интензивна нега и мораше да биде ставена во медицински индуцирана кома. По нешто повеќе од еден месец на интензивна нега, нејзината состојба беше стабилизирана, но неконтактна, од тешката состојба се афектирани и онеспособени сите моторни, визуални и говорни функции. Лекарите во Македонија и препорачаа дека итно и е потребен невролошки третман за рехабилитација, интензивна работна терапија, интензивна физикална терапија и рехабилитација во центри специјализирани за пациенти во таква состојба, кои не се достапни во Македонија. Тие препорачаа да се бараат такви болници во Турција, Словенија или Германија. Неколку болници негираа да ја прифатат или поради состојбата во која се наоѓа или поради пандемија со Ковид. Пред два дена таа беше пренесена во болницата Аџибадем во Истанбул, Турција и во моментов се во тек испитувања од тамошните лекари да можат да дадат одговор со конечната одлука дали може да продолжи нејзиното закрепнување таму и колку ќе чини, во меѓувреме добивме одговор од детската болница Хегау-Југендеверк во Германија дека ќе можат да ја прифатат пациентката доколку нејзиното лекување не може да се продолжи или успешно да се заврши во Истанбул, Турција, а трошокот ќе изнесува 60 200 евра (70 000 американски долари), дополнително на трошоците од 5000 евра потрешени за нејзиното транспортирање до Истанбул со амбулантна кола и придужба на медицинска екипа, како и сите други дполнителни трошоци доколку треба да биде транспортирано во Германија од Истанбул. Сите овие медицински сметки стават огромен товар врз секое семејство овие денови, и никој не може да биде подготвен за такво нешто, и како што може да се види, болницате бараат однапред да се плати целиот износ, и додека се чека конечниот одговор од Аџибадем во Истанбул, во име на Емилија и нејзините родители, јас, заедно со сите нивни роднини и пријатели, одлучивме да ја започнеме оваа кампања и да помогнеме со овој финансиски товар, и сите заедно да ја вратиме насмевката на лицето на Емилија и повторно да бидат едно цело заедно со нејзината сестричка Елена.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-pancreatitis-saga,The Pancreatitis Saga.," Some of you know me by Chance, whiskeyroller, or any other nick names my friends have given me. If you have known me throughout my life,  I’m sure you have witnessed my medical condition or have heard about it, and for those people who don’t know or want to know more... I have a chronic illness called pancreatitis. I was born without a gene in my pancreas which has led to me having this underlying condition since I was 3. My mom passed away of from it when I was 7. I use to be able to control it for the most part but this past year and a half has been the most difficult time of my life. I had gall stones for a year before they found them, these stones would make bad substances back up into my pancreas, and since I already have this underlying condition, it made things far worse and made my pancreas significantly weaker. After having my gall bladder taken out in March and after a whole year of dealing with hospital visits every other month , even though my gall bladder was taken out, the damage was already done. My pancreas is now very weak and not only is it weak, it now has to work even harder to digest food now that I have no gallbladder. I now have to watch my diet, no fat/ very low fat foods and if I eat anything with high fats I will end up back in the hospital and not eat or drink for weeks at a time. This condition has effected my life physically and mentally. I can’t do the things I use to, I can’t eat the things I use to, and I haven’t been able to hold a job because I am constantly in and out of the hospital.  With me having my own place and bills to pay, you can see how financial stress is also in play. Mentally it has been draining, coming from someone who has always had a job and been able to support himself financially, and also being In the hospital for weeks at a time also does a toll on your mental health. The hospital bills are stacking and stacking and I have applied for disability but it’s a whole long process to get approved and if you get denied then you have to restart the process over. I have a $1500 hospital deductible and that’s not to mention the countless doctor visits and bills every month just to live. Also eating healthy is extremely expensive and it’s mandatory if I want to stay out of the hospital. Next month I am going to Gainesville to see a specialist and right now can’t afford the trip as well. I am at the end of my savings and it has taken everything in me to keep away from this being that I am a giver and have worked hard for everything I have. I understand we are in hard times and money is tight for everyone, but every dollar will help! And if not I totally understand. Thank you!        -Chance Keys ",2983,7500,3 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/xctdd-danas-recovery-fund,Dana's Recovery Fund," Hello wonderful people! I'm setting up this fundraiser to help the amazing Dana Talmo cover some of their recent medical and living expenses. As many of you already know, Dana has been grappling with their mental health for a long time and on Wednesday, October 13th, they had the strength to check themself into the Emergency Department at UVMMC to get the help that they needed. After spending 3 days in the ED, Dana was transferred to an inpatient mental health facility where they were diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and stayed for another 13 days. I'm very happy to report that Dana has made some large strides on their road to recovery and was finally able to return home to their 4 chickens (the Chicky Ladies & Silkie), 3 stinky dogs (Remmy, Gandalf, and Earl), 2 cats (Ron and Jimmy), and 1 partner (thats me!). Although Dana has come sooo far from where they started, there is still a long journey of outpatient treatment ahead of them and they will not be able to return to work until at least January of 2022. What feels like an age ago, in June of 2020, Dana opened the doors of Talmo Hair Co. for business and poured their heart and soul into it. Then, after a year of operation, they took a huge leap and expanded the business, from a single chair small studio, to the amazing 3 chair salon you see today. You all have helped make their business an amazing success and we cannot thank you all enough for that. However, as the owner and currently the sole employee, they now have not only their medical expenses to cover, but also the business overhead as well as basic living expenses.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/aunt-kat-needs-our-help,Aunt Kat Needs Our Help!!!," My name is Kelly and I have know Kathryn “Kat” (Drain) Simard since she started hanging out with my little sister in high school. A few years later, the two girls visited me at my new place in Belleville.. and Kat met my roommate, Marty. Needless to say, he was the love of her life from the moment she saw him. If you know Kat and Marty, you know what wonderful people they are. They don’t think twice about helping anyone that needs help, whether if they know them or not. But now they need help and unfortunately, they are not getting it. Both of them being self employed, with Aunt Kat’s Pampered Pets Palace and Marty’s Maintenance Service, they have minimal health insurance. Marty had some health issues some time back and has been unable to work for most of the last two years, though is doing what he can now. But our dear Kat.. Kat was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and just had surgery today. She had to stop grooming at her shop and with chemo treatments in her future, it is hard to say when she’ll be able to work again. They’ve spent much of their savings over the last two years while missing Marty’s income. My goal with this gofundme is to raise the $5000 Kat needs to pay her medical deductible. Please give anything you can. And if you’ve ever been on the receiving end of their generosity in the past.. this is your chance to pay it back.  ",4165,5000,1 day
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-with-legal-medical-expenses-for-jesi,Help with Legal & Medical Expenses for Jesi," Hi all, my name is Marty Bender, Jesi Bender (Uribe) is my wife. I'll start off by saying it truly pains me to write this as we're never ones to ask anyone for help. For those of you who don't know, Jesi was diagnosed with cervical cancer earlier this week. We're still waiting on advanced imaging to be done to know whether it has spread, but if it has not spread she's looking at having a radical hysterectomy done to hopefully remove the cancer, with the possibility of requiring chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  The reason I am creating this is that we are facing a true financial hardship. While there's never a good time to get cancer, there really couldn't have been a worse time. The first hurdle is that we're in the middle of buying a home. We've already taken money from Jesi's 401k and have put the majority of our savings into this purchase so while we would normally have had a contingency fund for something like this, we are temporarily low on funds. The second big hurdle is that after Jesi delivered Mackenzie in May of 2020, she went on an extended medical leave for postpartum and used up all of her state disability benefits, meaning that the 6+ weeks she's going to be required to be out of work will be almost entirely unpaid time off after her sick and vacation time is exhausted. Both of these factors have led me to write this and put my pride to the side for the benefit of my family. The reason it also says legal fees is because of the story of how Jesi was diagnosed. Beginning in November of 2020 Jesi began complaining to her primary care doctor that she was having a lot of irregular bleeding despite being on birth control. Her primary care doctor consulted with her OBGYN and the OBGYN said ""tell her to change her birth control if she doesn't want to bleed"" and left it at that despite the fact that Jesi had been on this particular birth control for years without any issues. Then again in February 2021 Jesi went back to her primary care doctor with complaints of vaginal pain and irregular bleeding and was told that she needed to schedule an appointment with her OBGYN. In April 2021 Jesi went to visit with her OBGYN and made complaints again about irregular bleeding, extreme pain, etc. The doctor's suggestion was to ""change soap, laundry detergent, and wear loose fitting clothing"" aka he dismissed her concerns. I was upset with this as she wasn't getting better and I told her to schedule another appointment with him and that I was going to attend. So in May 2021 she was seen once again by her OBGYN with me present. Everything I brought up he immediately dismissed saying ""this isn't that, stay off of Google."" Jesi once again complained of irregular, frequent bleeding and extreme pain and he ran a vaginal swab for STD's and vaginitis. In her records he wrote a diagnosis for vaginitis, even though the vaginitis panel ultimately came back as negative.  Frustrated with her care Jesi said she gave up trying to get answers but I wasn't done. For those who know my story, my mother passed away at age 39. The tragedy was that my mother diagnosed herself years before the doctors ever did. Her primary doctor was so dismissive of her concerns that she actually wrote in my mom's medical chart that she needed a psychiatrist and not a medical doctor. Frustrated by years of medical issues not improving she finally got accepted to go to the MAYO clinic. There she was finally diagnosed with Lupus (SLE) and told that it was terminal, she passed away soon after. The thing is that lupus when caught early can be managed and most people can live a decently long life. I was 15 when I got my permit so I could drive my mom to many of her doctor's appointments and I wish I had spoken up then but instead I trusted doctor's to help my mom. So when I saw Jesi not getting answers, I wasn't about to just let this go. I called back to Lompoc Valley Medical Center and asked that they schedule her with a different OBGYN (they have 3) and was told that the doctors do not see each other's patients once they've established with another OBGYN. I called the office manager for the clinic and she confirmed that the policy was in fact that they did not do in house second opinions on their colleagues patients. When I commented that ""so they're putting their ego and pride over patient care, and you're ok with that?"" her answer was ""well when you put it like that it sounds bad but that is absolutely the policy and there's nothing I can do about it."" Once again, Jesi was left hurting, bleeding, and without answers. I ultimately called 17 different OBGYN's offices literally begging them to get Jesi in but every office had a 6+ month wait. I had all but given up myself when late one evening we got a call from a doctor who said she had been told about me calling everyone and she wanted to know what she could do to help. She agreed to see Jesi the next week and she was nothing short of amazing. She took Jesi's complaints seriously, ran several tests, did a full PAP smear and exam. After the exam she sat us down in her office and talked about possibilities and what could be causing the issues and promised Jesi that she would get to the bottom of it. The next week we were told that the PAP showed abnormal cells and that Jesi would need to be scheduled for a colposcopy where they would need to take some biopsies. The procedure was scheduled right away and the biopsies were collected. Jesi told the doctor ""whatever results you get, don't make me wait, please just call me."" So within 48 hours the doctor called Jesi and told her the news that no one ever wants to hear, that she in fact had adenocarcinoma cervical cancer. Within days she was scheduled for a CT with contrast and an ultrasound.  Today, she met with her gynecological oncologist for the first time and was told that the cancer involved about 70% of her cervix but hopes were high that it had not spread but that to be sure additional tests (PET & MRI) would have to be done. Best case scenario the cancer is stage 1B2 and the treatment plan is a radical hysterectomy. I asked the oncologist “based on what you’ve seen, how long has she had this” and his response was that it was a slow growing cancer and that based on how involved her uterus was, that it had likely been there for years. Which got me wondering, Jesi had had PAP smears done yearly so how is it that it was missed. And when I went through her medical records I discovered something shocking. In 2019, Jesi’s PAP smear results read “Interpretation: Abnormal: ATYPICAL GLANDULAR CELLS (AGC) – ENDOCERVICAL TYPE” I spoke with two OBGYN’s who were both shocked because this finding is extremely rare, as low as .18% of all PAP smears have this finding, and of those that do 20%-50% have a finding of intraepithelial neoplasia or adenocarcinoma. So as it turns out this test over 2 years ago was the red flag that something was wrong. Both OBGYN’s stated that this finding should have 100% of the time been immediately scheduled for a colposcopy. That’s 2 years of this cancer growing and spreading when the doctor knew, or should have known about it. And then in 2020 her PAP states “Specimen Adequacy: Endocervical component absent” which according to the guidelines states that when a previous PAP is abnormal, the test should have been repeated, which wasn’t done so yet again the doctor messed up. And then, a patient who has had these abnormal PAP smears in the past that indicate possible cancer, and is complaining of irregular bleeding and vaginal pain which both indicate possible cancer, but doesn’t do any additional testing is just beyond me.  So that said we did contact an attorney. One of the OBGYN’s even stated that he’s never encouraged someone to consult an attorney but this was REALLY bad and that we needed to find someone. So while my main focus is on getting Jesi better, the hospital is run by the county so there’s only a 6 month window to file an intent to sue before you lose the ability to so time is of the essence to get the process started. But therein lies the problem, that even though medical malpractice cases are contingency, the attorneys won’t take the case without first getting an independent medical opinion which is paid for by the client. In our case the estimate was $2,000-$3,000+. So all in all, we’re facing some pretty steep financial challenges in the weeks and months to come and we would be eternally grateful to all who can help us through this difficult time and hopefully be able to pass it on when we can put this chapter of our life behind us. Even if you can’t donate, a share can help us get the word out to find additional donors. We love and appreciate all of you who we call friends or family, and if we don’t know you you’re generosity is truly a blessing. Thanks and I’ll keep this updated as things unfold so you can follow along as things progress.  ",2100,5000,20 hours

Blaine lives in Michigan with his wife Sue and even though he is 76 years old, he still works 40 hours a week because he ""can't sit still"". Blaine came to the Central Coast to visit Randy and I on the 15th of this month. When he arrived, it was clear that he was struggling and getting tired easily.. After two days with us he began to run a fever and after a rapid test, we discovered that Blaine was Covid positive. Blaine, Randy and I are all vaccinated, but that didn't stop it from making us all sick. After a week of caring for Blaine at home, it was clear that he was in an emergency situation. Blaine has been in the hospital since Sunday where he has continued to need more and more oxygen to combat the Covid pneumonia in his lungs . As of today, he is fighting like hell to stay off of a ventilator and he is at maximum oxygen. He has received an experimental drug and we are all praying that it begins to work. We need all of the positive thoughts we can get but also, it's clear that this will be a long journey for Blaine. He will likely not be able to work for a long time, if at all, and he will have medical bills that won't be covered by his insurance. For anyone who wants to help, please consider donating some cash to Blaine and Sue to help rebuild their lives after Blaine gets through this. We love Blaine and so many of you do too. Let's give him some hope knowing that his health can be his top priority and we can help with the bills. Thank you all for your support. With gratitude, Randy and Natalie Morrell ",6435,1000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/pnm9wv-fundraiser-for-sarah-rice,Fundraiser for Sarah Rice," As many of you know, Sarah has been battling a brain tumor for what has now been 11 years. Sarah has faced this tumor with incredible, persistent courage, in spite of its harrowing toll, devastating reiterations and debilitating effects.  As much as she wishes she didn’t need to ask for it, those of us close to Sarah know that she pressingly needs our help for some medical costs and other financial essentials she cannot do without.  We would be so grateful if you could contribute whatever you can to help alleviate Sarah’s financial burden. In particular, her medical insurance has stopped covering essential doctor visits without which she stops being able to see or walk, and her computer, without which she cannot edit photos or take on assignments, has broken down.  Sarah cringes at sharing too much of what the last few years have actually been like for her, but for those wondering, this is just a tiny glimpse of what our badass, super talented, brave friend has gone through. For over a decade, fighting to be alive and as functional as possible has involved Sarah undergoing two brain surgeries, hundreds of doctor visits, participation in a grueling clinical trial, and daily medication and injections most of us would wince at the very idea of.  Two years ago, in one of the latest efforts to combat this tumor, Sarah underwent radiation that involved the physical clamping of her neck and doctors drilling three holes into her head. As so often happens in these situations, the effects of treatment on Sarah’s functioning have been on a par with the effects of the tumor itself.  Among many other side effects she has had to find ways to live with, for the last two years, Sarah has experienced the chronic seizing up of her neck, blinding migraines, an extreme sensitivity to light and a persistent loss of vision that have had her lying in a basement, mask on, unable to go outside for weeks – sometimes months – on end.  Throughout, and as usual, Sarah has remained devoted to photography. On the days she could carve out the ability to see and walk, she took on assignments for outlets like the New York Times and worked on a grant she won from the National Geographic, making the most beautiful of images and fighting to create empathy through her work for others.  But work, and making ends meet, have inevitably taken a backseat to fighting for a base level of health. As a freelancer, Sarah is not entitled to proper governmental support through disability payments. Sarah’s biggest source of support is her community. It’s us.  Please do chip in with anything you can, so we can alleviate some of Sarah’s burden. We are so grateful for your support! ",20117,25000,20-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jack-get-his-life-back-from-cancer,Please Help Save Jacek from Cancer,"Team fundraiserMike Higby and Michelle Roberts are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Justyna Mordzinski.In July 2019 our family’s world was shaken to the core when my husband Jacek was diagnosed with Stage 4 Anaplastic Carcinoma, a rare and extremely aggressive thyroid cancer that was threatening to take him from our lives much too soon. I can still remember the fear in Jacek’s eyes as the doctor explained that he would be required to undergo extensive surgery to remove the entire thyroid but together as a family, and with the grace of God, Jacek’s surgery was successful, and he began radiation and chemotherapy that November. The treatments were so hard on Jacek. He was constantly in pain and so frail, but he always remained hopeful as we prayed for heaven’s light to touch our lives and help our family through this devastating time. It was heart-breaking to watch the love of my life wilting away and our young children, who were only 8 and 4 years old at the time, could not fully understand why their once strong and playful father was no longer able to chase them in a game of tag or play hide and seek. Jacek’s once strong body had become so weak, he was no longer able to work and at times, barely had the strength to hold his children in his arms or even clasp his fingers around mine. I was watching my best friend, my love, my rock fade away, and just when we thought the worst was behind us as the chemotherapy seemed to be working to fight the cancer riddling his body...we were dealt another devastating blow.The chemo that was supposed to be saving Jacek’s life had caused chemo-induced leukemia. This news was delivered to us this past July and at that moment it was like time stopped and our world came crashing down upon us. Two years of Jacek fighting so hard to survive thyroid cancer have now led to us being informed he has only a few months left to live. This is due to no possibility of a bone marrow transplant to treat the luekemia as the existing thyroid cancer is active and has spread.This can’t be his destiny...he has so much more left to give to this world...there must be hope.We immediately began seeking other options for treatment and thankfully we discovered an alternative treatment that is less invasive and has a real chance to save Jacek’s life. A chance to allow Jacek to watch our amazingly beautiful children grow into adults. To attend their graduations, their weddings, and one day hold his grandchildren in his arms...but we need your help to get Jacek the treatment he deserves. After two years of continued cancer treatments, our savings have been depleted as we paid all treatments up to this date on our own and my income alone cannot provide the financial means to cover the cost of treatment, which is over half a million dollars . Thankfully, one of Jacek’s good friends, Mike, has taken it upon himself to set up this campaign for Jacek and we are so thankful and so blessed for his selfless contribution. It is our prayer that with your generous support, we will be able to admit Jacek into the clinic and save him from the fate he has been assigned by current physicians.100% of your generous donations will go directly towards the cost of the non-invasive procedures  in the hopes of treating the cancer that is trying to steal Jacek from our lives. It is so difficult to put what Jacek means to us in words and even more difficult to turn to others for help. However, I must do everything I can to give Jacek a fighting chance as his will may be strong, but his body is weakening by the day. He needs our support to fight this horrible disease. Jacek is only 38 years old and has so much to give to this world. He has always been such a kind, giving man with a heart of gold. We pray daily for guidance and the strength to continue to fight as I cannot and will not imagine a day when I would have to tell our children their father is gone.There is always hope and we cannot thank you enough for your support and your prayers during this very difficult time. We ask that you please find it in your heart to also share our campaign with your family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers so that together, we can provide the means to give Jacek a fighting chance. Thank you all and God bless.",78309,500000,18-Aug-21

Sara is one of the most caring and loving people that I have ever met.

Sara's family urgently needs support so she can stay in a facility to stay safe and to regain her health while establishing the diagnosis and best course of treatment. Giving any amount would help as this has been a very unexpected turn of events with a current financial impact of thirty thousand dollars. All of our hearts are broken and we hope you can somehow find it in yourself to help this beautiful family in their biggest time of need.

In June, when the lump had grown to the size of a small lime, a mammogram and three biopsies revealed what I most dreaded: Breast Cancer.  I endured eight long months of debilitating chemotherapy, but I made it through! Now, I continue living with Metastatic (Stage IV) Breast Cancer, as there is no cure. I attend maintenance treatment every three weeks with intermittent medication for my bones and to keep my estrogen levels as low as possible in order to suppress the system that overproduces the unwanted cancer cells.  That said, the future is uncertain and the impact of breast cancer treatment on my long-term health may be many. As I continue to adjust to the physical, psychological, and emotional affects of this disease and treatment, I’ve learned that my life and the lives of my loved ones will never be the same. More than ever I want to live a life filled with the things that bring me joy! Working as a school psychologist for the NYC Department of Education has been one of the most rewarding jobs I have had, but unfortunately, my condition has created impairments to complete these duties to the best of my ability. I can no longer continue to sustain the level of energy this position demands. The responsibilities are becoming much too great for my physical and mental capacity. It is for this reason that I need to set on a new path. My goal is to raise enough money over the next few years to open a small day care and art studio space for learning, creating, and discovering the arts open to all ages as a community center.

She is having many health issues right now. She has had Diabetes since 2001. She is having Gastroparsis problems as well as neuropathy in both feet. Last year, we found out that she has Diabetic Retinopathy. She had surgery on her left eye and eye injections on the right eye. The small cataract in the right eye she had in March has grown so much that surgery is needed to restore sight in that eye. She has also been dealing with neurological problems as well. She had to go to the UNC Neurological Clinic this summer to be seen. She has no health insurance so everything is out of pocket.  She had to be out of work in 2020 because her workplace was closed because of the Covid19 pandemic. All of these expenses are so overwhelming.   She is currently unable to drive as well.  She has to have cataract surgery on her right eye. This will be on December the 7th at Graystone Eye Center in Hickory.   She will be out of work on the 7th and 8th to recover.  We appreciate any amount you are able to donate. If you are not able to donate we appreciate the prayers so very much. Thanks so much for your love and kindness. ",2540,3000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/liams-transplant-journey,Liam's Bone Marrow Transplant Journey,"Xandra Towndrow is organizing this fundraiser. Liam is the nicest, warmest and funniest eight-year-old boy you can meet. He never hesitates to give you a hug and is sure to put a smile on your face. He is fascinated by dinosaurs and is an awesome math wiz. Liam also has Fanconi anemia. Fanconi anemia is a DNA repair disease that causes bone marrow insufficiency and poses a very high risk for certain cancers at a young age. We all have an FA pathway with a set of genes that are involved in repairing our DNA when it's damaged, but in a person with Fanconi anemia this pathway does not work as well, so they are more susceptible to disease. We visited the hospital on Monday for an annual bone marrow biopsy and found that Liam’s Hemoglobin was only 4.7. You usually transfuse at 7. He was admitted immediately and had to receive 3 transfusions to ensure that his level was stable enough to return home. This is an indicator that Liam is in bone marrow failure and a bone marrow transplant will be required as soon as possible to prevent transfusion dependence. Since FA is so rare, there are only a handful of centers in the country that specialize in bone marrow transplant protocols. All of this happened very suddenly so we were unable to visit any of the centres or find a donor for Liam. During this incredibly stressful time, the two of us are not paid for our time without work. We are asking for assistance to cover travel, accommodation and, ultimately, the bills that will continue during transplant. One of us will stay home and work, but the only one income will scarcely support the household. These are extremely stressful times and we appreciate your assistance. With your help, we have an opportunity to focus on Liam's health and help him overcome this next hurdle. ",3653,10000,13-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/brm9gy-help-gabriel-fight-cancer,Help Gabriel Fight Cancer!," Our nephew Gabriel is fighting what no child should have to- the fight against cancer. Gabriel is 16 years old, a high school junior who should be learning to drive, hanging with friends and listening to terrible teenage music. Instead he has spent much of the last several months as an inpatient at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. This journey began with intermittent leg pain. When his mother Rose took him to an Urgent Care visit, X-rays were taken. Things rapidly progressed within one week- from casual Urgent Care visit, to meeting with Oncologists and Orthopedic surgeons who were definite in stating the scariest words to any mother- “it’s cancer” CHOP has given swift and extensive care due to the diagnosis of Osteosarcoma. Since August, Gabriel has endured inpatient chemo, extra visits for terrible side effects, blood transfusions, biopsies, a feeding tube.. the list goes on. Rose has been with Gabriel for every step, and they live at CHOP together most days of the week. Constant testing and meetings for Gabriel has removed all normality from the family’s lives. A tumor removal surgery was performed 10/27, leaving Gabriel with a knee replacement at sixteen years old. While Rose is in the hospital with her eldest son, Gabriel’s brother Rowan is being cared for by his Grandmother Kelly, Aunt Maria and Uncle Jim, and Uncle Steven and Aunt Lauren. Virtual school is new to everyone, but we are getting by! Everyone seems to be “doing ok”, if such a thing can be said. Gabriel is fighting through all the symptoms as best he can with the brave assistance of Rose, who is at his side night and day. Rowan is a happy kid who bounces around with his duffel bag and tablet, but somehow always forgets his school bag. This temporary new normal is being handled by everyone with grace and patience, but support is needed. Rose has been unable to work since this diagnosis, due to the truly godawful nature of Osteosarcoma treatment and side effects and surgery. She has exhausted almost all sick and vacation time at work, and is far from returning. While treatment is going according to everyone’s hopes, additional testing and inpatient chemo stays will stretch well into 2022.  Her job has been supportive, but Rose will soon need more assistance to keep the fight going without additional monetary stress. She needs our help. Our hope is to raise enough money for Rose to be able to cover her typical bills for the next six months, as that is the anticipated length of treatment.  We humbly ask that you consider donating to Gabriel’s Fight, or sharing this story with others. Any amount would be greatly appreciated and put to immediate use as the family continues to fight and endure and conquer Osteosarcoma.Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, The Trauger Family For updates, please check out Gabriel’s Journey on Facebook for updates from Rose and the rest of the family.https://facebook.com/groups/1397534840628994/?ref=group_browse ",4070,20000,8 hours
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-tony-recover-from-covid,Help Tony Recover from COVID!," Please pray for Tony Martinez!!  Tony has COVID and has been in a medically induced coma since October 20th, fighting for his life. He was at St. Luke's Hospital, intubated, medically sedated and paralyzed, and in a RotoProne bed, which rotates him back and forth to help heal his lungs. On Monday, October 25, Tony started to decline. They had to increase his oxygen to 90%, his white blood cell count increased again, and he still had a fever. All of their efforts were not enough to help him. That night he was rushed to Cleveland Clinic and put on an ECMO machine. The ECMO machine bypasses his heart and lungs, and pumps his blood through a machine that cleans and oxygenates his blood.  We know he is strong, and can pull through, but even then, he has a long road ahead of him. He will have physical therapy and lifelong damage from this. Conservatively, he is facing over $100,000, just for the hospital bills. It's an astronomical amount. We know it's a long shot to cover all these costs for him, but we're going to try.  The last thing we want him to worry about is money for his kids and the ever growing hospital bills. He needs to focus all of his energy on recovery.  Tony has two beautiful children, Mya and Roman, who just want their dad to come home. They are the light of his life. They miss their dad horribly. Tony will be 37 years old next month, he has so much life ahead of him.  Anything you are able to donate is appreciated more than you know!!  Please, please pray hard for Tony and his kids! We need him to come home. All donations will go directly to Tony for his recovery, children, and hospital bills.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts ❤️  ",2770,100000,23 hours
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-bessem-for-breast-cancer-treatment,Help Bessem  on Breast  Cancer Treatment," My name is Bessem Ebanga Bisong, aged 42 , seeking financial support to undergo treatment for breast and Lung cancer. It all started in February 2019 when I discovered I had a lump in my breast and after proper examination through a biopsy it was concluded that it is a stage 1 breast cancer. After doing all the prescribed tests, I was placed on chemotherapy while waiting for the test that gives more precise details and treatment of the cancer. After 4 series of chemotherapies, the test finally came indicating that my cancer is hormonal. Chemo was stopped and I was put on a hormonal treatment which entails taking a tablet per day for 5 years. Alongside the treatment, I had surgery whereby my entire left breast was taken off. The next step of my treatment was to do radiotherapy. This I could not do because the only machine we have in Cameroon is in Douala and by the time I went for my appointment it was bad and put out of service till further notice. While waiting, I carried on with my hormonal therapy while going for check- ups as prescribed by the doctor. After being on the hormones for more than 8 months, I noticed another lump growing directly on the scar of the surgery. This lump was removed, tested and the results came back positive of cancer. Along the line I also had this dry cough for months that just won’t go away no matter what drugs I was prescribed. With all these happenings, I was prescribed a total body scan. The results came back not only showing that the cancer in the breast is still there, but also it had moved to the lungs. I was immediately asked to stop the hormonal therapy and was placed on another 4 series of chemo which I did. Unfortunately further investigation showed that the chemo only stabilized the cancer both in the breast and lungs instead of eradicating it. With all these, it was concluded that all the different treatments I have had so far have not been successful. At this point the doctor completely changed the treatment and placed me on double therapy ie hormones and chemo. This treatment is so radical and I wonder if my body will be able to stand it. After taking just 2 secessions of this combined therapy, I have lost more than 14 kilos. In a nutshell, the past 2 years have been full of expenses for treatment with no improvement. Strongly believe there is a possible medical solution for complete healing. I was recommended to Global Medical facilitating medical evacuation in Cameroon and together with their support the sorted for a more advanced medical treatment in India which will cost 16000USD with a 95% chances of survival . Within 2 year I have spent all my saving and my condition keep worsening by the day. I believe through the GO FUND ME with every small support I will achieve my dreams of seeking an advance treatment in India. I therefore use this opportunity and medium to plead with everyone who will come across my story, that your financial assistance no matter how small will go a long way to help me get proper treatment. Thank you and God bless you. Ms Bessem Arrey Ebanga Bisong ",6595,16000,22-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/stephanie-brocks-cancer-fight-and-miracle-fund,Stephanie Brock's Cancer Fight and Miracle Fund," In April 2018, Stephanie Brock was diagnosed at the age of 37 with triple-negative breast cancer. Since then she has gone through numerous surgeries, chemo treatments, radiation, countless scans, ER visits, trips to Mayo Clinic, etc. Throughout this process the cancer spread to her lymph nodes, lungs and brain. This week Stephanie received the news that the cancer had also spread to her spinal fluid (this is called leptomeningeal disease). Although this means she has a very tough road ahead, she is not letting this stop her from continuing to fight. For those that know Stephanie, either personally or from work, you know that she has been a super hero during the last 3.5 years. She has not only worked up until this summer through all her chemo and every ER visit, but worked double shifts and 50-60 hour weeks most of the time. She would be in the ER until the middle of the night and still go to work the next day. She loved working at Fox Harbor. It provided her an outlet to just be Steph and talk to her customers, which was one of her favorite things to do. Unfortunately with her most recent diagnoses and symptoms (Pneumonia, sinus infection, dizziness, headaches, neck pain, ect.) she can no longer work. She is not sure when or if she will be able to return. With Stephanie not working, both her medical and regular bills continue to pile up at this point. I hope we can help to alleviate some of the financial burden cancer has caused, especially now that Stephanie is physically not able to work. Lets show her our support and allow her to focus on her treatments and continuing to make memories with family and friends. If financial help isn't feasible for you, we completely understand. Stephanie also needs as many prayers as she can get right now. All of your support and prayers have helped to get her this far. She is fighting for her life more than ever before and appreciates the people who have rallied around her. Stephanie and her family thank you from the bottom of their hearts. Together we pray for a miracle. Thank you all, for everything. ",16325,20000,21-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/rn6gr6-xxxxx,Love My Way... For My Friends In Need,"Team fundraiserGAIL ANN  DORSEY and Frank Coleman are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Catherine Ashton. My name is Gail Ann Dorsey. I am a singer/songwriter/composer/bass guitarist. I also happen to love writing, and helping my friends. That is why I did not hesitate when my friend Catherine Ashton asked if I would initiate this GoFundMe campaign to help her and her family in a time of dire need… Yes, I love writing, but this is a topic, a situation, a reality that I really wish I could have avoided ever spelling out in words. Chapter 1: John Ashton has cancer. The Back Story… The first time I met John, and at the time his soon-to-be-wife, Catherine was in 1993. I had just started spending time in the Woodstock area as a visitor. I was still living in London, England where I had been living for 11 years prior to my eventually relocating to the Hudson Valley in 1994, and settling in Uptown Kingston where I have put down roots since 1996. I had plans set in motion to return to The States from the UK, but wasn’t sure exactly where I wanted to live. John was next door neighbours with bassist Sara Lee (B-52’s, Indigo Girls, Gang Of Four), who is one of my closest and dearest friends, and how I discovered and ended up coming to live in this creative and progressive community. I remember thinking how cool that the bass player from The B-52’s was living right next door to the guitarist from The Psychedelic Furs! Surely, this must be the place to be if you’re a musician in The United States! I attended John and Catherine's wedding in 1993 on one of my visits to Woodstock (I even have a bunch of home videos of the event!), and since that time they have turned out to be two of the kindest, most loving, and loyal friends I could ever wish to have. In 2007, their first child, Oliver, was born. The Great “REVILO”! A sweet little genius that I’m certain will contribute something truly wonderful to this world. I mean, I can remember this little thinker reading War and Peace when he was 10 years old! Then came their second child, Tallulah, in 2010. A spirited little beauty with the biggest, warmest heart, and smarts to boot! I call her “Lady T.”! The kids have called me “Auntie Gail” since they were able to speak, and I can tell you, it fills me with joy to see their drawings on my refrigerator everyday! John is also a much loved ""Grandfather""!  I met his first born child, daughter Sophie, when she was around 9 years old and visiting the USA from Ireland to attend her father's wedding to Catherine.  Sophie is John's daughter from a previous union and has lived her entire life in Ireland where she is now a mother with five children of her own! ~ From left to right in the photo below, Baby Lexi,  Sophie, Chloe, Luke, (Uncle) Oliver, Conor, Mia and (Aunt) Tallulah!I have only once had a chance to see Sophie with her children when they came to New York for a visit a few years ago.  The family ""Love-Fest"" was unmistakeable when I met them all for a classic ""American Diner"" breakfast experience in Kingston.  It goes without saying how much John's grand kids would like the chance to spend many, many more years getting to know their super cool Grand Dad, and without question, that wish, and that pray runs both ways...John has one sister back in the UK who is also praying for John's speedy recovery.  Margaret ""Mags"" Stocks, and John's nephew and twin nieces, Jonny, Lizzie and Sarah, have already had to face the horrible tragedy of losing a loved one to this awful disease when she lost her husband and their father Dean to lung cancer in June of 2018. Born in London, England in 1957, John Ashton has been a permanent US resident and member of the Hudson Valley community since 1991. He fell in love with The Catskills in 1982 when his band spent 6 weeks recording their classic ‘Forever Now’ album with producer Todd Rundgren. John is one of the original guitarists and songwriters of one of the most well-known, influential, and highly acclaimed British bands of the 20th Century, The Psychedelic Furs; a band that gave the world such classic gems as “Heaven”, “Love My Way”, “The Ghost In You” and of course “Pretty In Pink”. Although John has not been an active member of The Furs for some time now, he has remained active and in love with music. His musical history as guitarist/producer includes projects with Sisters Of Mercy and Marianne Faithful, as well as collaborations with fellow local bands like Mercury Rev. Together, John and I worked with some of our local youth aspiring musicians conducting songwriting and various music workshops for ‘School Of Rock’ founder Paul Green, who helped established the still active and thriving ‘Rock Academy’ of Woodstock. In 2016, John wrote, produced, and recorded an album of brand new material under the name Satellite Paradiso; a bold and classic “rock” album in the true sense of the tradition with an awesome line up of musicians, including bassist Sara Lee, vocalist Fred Schreck, and drummer Frank Coleman, as well as guests musicians from Mercury Rev, Anthony Molina, Grasshopper, and Jonathan Donahue, to name a few… and of course, yours truly also appearing on bass and vocals on a few tunes! ;-) As most can imagine, unless you are exploding on the streaming charts, or out touring “on the road” for six months a year (or perhaps even more!), supporting a family as a musician is becoming increasingly more difficult and uncertain—especially in these pandemic times! To supplement the pay check-to-pay check income that still remains from John’s musical endeavours, he has been working in the film industry since 1998. This employment has  been a reliable solution for keeping John and his family afloat, while still affording him the opportunity to continue to work at what he loves and does best, music. Now, it all must stop. The Present Scenario… On June 8th of this year John was diagnosed with Stage 4 Prostate Cancer that had spread to his lymph nodes, therefore making treatment more challenging. Surgery is not an option. He has just begun what will be an indefinite series of treatments involving radiation, hormone therapies, and possibly access to clinical trials through Sloan Kettering in New York City.  Most health insurance policies for the average person are often never enough to cover the unexpected and inevitable snowballing expenses in situations such as this. For a condition like John’s we already know that the costs of his treatments will be overwhelming and astronomical. Starting now, John will also be unable to continue working on a regular basis, and there is no safety net to realistically support or break an approaching financial fall. He has already weakened his condition and stretched himself thin continuing to show up for work up until this point. For John, all exertions, stresses, and worries must be minimized, if not eliminated for the critical months ahead. He needs help to support his family, keep his home, keep is dignity, and pay for any unfortunate surprises that health insurance may not cover. The Ashton Family needs financial help to nurse and comfort their state of mind… one of the most important factors in the healing process that faces this family. Love My Way… It never feels quite appropriate to me to equate love with money, but in unfortunate and stressful circumstances like this, where your donations, however big or small, can help alleviate the current and looming financial burdens on John and his family, I can think of no better way to express your love and compassion. Healing requires not only what takes place physically, but just as important, if not more so, a mental and emotional state that is calm, focused, and free of stress. The ominous clouds of consequences that persistently hover above, threatening to rain, are the last thing the Ashton Family needs to contend with while entering a battle with such a formidable foe as cancer. I want to see my friends free of those fears and worries. Most of all, I want to see my friend John embarking on his mission to regain his health and well-being with all of the physical, mental, and emotion ammunition he can muster, and all fear of potential worldly ruin laid to rest. This is what ALL human beings deserve in times of an unavoidable health crisis. The unexpected arrival of illness should never have such a hefty price tag.  Unfortunately, that is often not the reality that faces a person with serious illness in the United States.  The cost of care itself can become an additional crippling affliction.  So, here we are. Human Being Lovers. Music Lovers. Lovers of Family and Friendships. I humbly ask you to please help my friend John Ashton and his family get through this harrowing and uncertain chapter of their lives if you are able. Your donation is the way to show your love... Love this way... Please spread the word… I Thank You… I Pray… … I desperately want to write a happy ending to this story… ",76247,100000,24-Aug-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/yrrp7-help-jason-fight-cancer,Help Jason Fight Cancer," My brother Jason was diagnosed with stage 4 tongue cancer on June 21, 2021 at only 44 years old. No one ever expects to hear those words, but this is Jason's reality. He is a wonderful father of 2 beautiful girls, a great brother, son, uncle, die hard Bills fan and friend to so many. He's hard working, dedicated, has an easy going personality and is just all around amazing person. He's strong and positive and will do anything he can to fight this and live and be here for his girls! After diagnosis, a plan was put in place. He started his first round of induction chemotherapy on July 6, 2021 to try and shrink the cancer before surgery. He experienced a major bleed a few days later and had to be rushed to the ER, he lost over 2 units of blood and had to receive a blood transfusion and was put on a clotting medicine. Second round of Chemo was 3 weeks later, and last one on August 17, 2021. He was still working as much as he could this entire time, he's dedicated and committed to his job and position at Beauty Pools. He had his good days and those he would choose to forget, but all apart of the treatment. Surgery was set for September 16th, the cancer ended up being more intense and evasive in his right lymph nodes then they were expecting and it had spread to some of his left lymph nodes as well. The surgery was over 8 hours and very intense. They had to remove more then half of his tongue and reconstruct it with muscle and nerves from his forearm, a piece of his 4 leaf clover tattoo is now part of his new tongue.  All teeth on the right side of his mouth were extracted. A PEG tube was placed for his nutrition.  He was in the ICU for a few days and then moved to the 7th floor. He was the ideal patient while in the hospital, the nurses all loved him and were amazed at how well he was recovering and his strength and positive attitude. He was out of the hospital after 1 week, truly amazing! He's been home and it's been a roller coaster of good days and tougher ones, but taking it one day at a time. Stitches have been removed, healing continues everyday. Weight is still very low 117lbs, but he's positive and strong. He's not able to eat anything, only drinks little sips of water, and enjoys some homemade vanilla ice cream made by a dear friend. All of his nutrition is through his PEG tube.   He's had a lot of Dr. appointments and planning the last few weeks for the next step of beating this, it's still a long road ahead. Because the cancer was so intense and intertwined on his right lymph nodes there's still a chance cancer is there. Jason now will be undergoing concurrent radiation treatment and chemotherapy. Radiation will be every week day for 7 weeks and chemotherapy will be once a week for the duration as well. Potential start date in early November. If you are able to, please consider a donation to help with Jason's medical expenses including his nutrition, copays, prescriptions and medical bills.  It would also significantly help with everyday living expenses for him and his contribution to expenses for his beautiful girls.  He hasn't been able to work since before the surgery in September, but Beauty Pools has been very supportive of him and his battle. Looking even further down the road he will also need major dental reconstruction. We truly appreciate anyway you can help ease the burden of his expenses so Jason can continue to focus on what's most important, his health and beating cancer! Thank you for all of the positive thoughts, prayers, love, generosity and support given through his battle so far.  It all helps him get through day by day and truly means so much to him and our entire family.    Cancer sucks but we appreciate all of you so much! Jason's got this, Swiatek Strong!  Go Bills!!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kierans-fight-with-covid,Kieran’s Covid Journey,"Team fundraiserBarbara Allen and Mark Allen are organizing this fundraiser. On 07/25/2021, Kieran McGovern tested positive for COVID-19 and as a result of the illness, he was admitted several times to his local hospital. Despite being only 22 years old, he developed severe pneumonia and his last admission resulted in a much longer stay and a longer recovery prognosis. Fortunately, doctors were able to have him flown to AdventHealth in Orlando (about 2 hours from home) where he could receive much more intensive care and be assigned an ECMO machine that handles all his blood oxygenation (similar to what you might be connected to during open heart surgery). He's had several pneumothoraces (likely from extended time on the ventilator, which he's still on), multiple DVT's, bacterial infections, allergic reactions to meds, multiple bronchoscopies, a tracheostomy, and is currently also deeply sedated and on a paralytic to give him time for his body to heal. Other patients on his floor getting this level of treatment have been on ECMO from anywhere between 50 to more than 200 days. While Kieran is a real fighter and his doctors are confident that he will recover, they do expect this will be a long recovery. He had acute respiratory failure and now has ARDS...so the difficulty doesn't end when he gets discharged. He will not be able to work for 6-12 months after he's released... and it looks like that might be several months from now. That said, on top of the obvious emotional strain of having her son hospitalized and in critical condition, this has already put an immense amount of financial pressure on his mother, Barbara, who needs to handle not only meeting his high deductible and out of pocket max, but also the rapidly accumulating expenses of an extended stay in Orlando to be with him during his recovery.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-lisa-her-daughter-beat-cancer,Help Lisa & Her Daughter Beat Cancer," My name is Heather, I am lucky enough to know Lisa. I coach her at our Crossfit gym. She comes in after working 12 hour night shifts to do burpees. Yup, a tough cookie to say the least. Lisa has been diagnosed with Stage 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. For this type of breast cancer, she will undergo surgery along with daily radiation for 5 weeks.  She is a hard worker, so taking time off of her emergency veterinarian job to focus on her health and undergo treatment is a big ask. She is a single mother, and unfortunately no stranger to cancer. She has a beautiful 6-year-old daughter who was diagnosed with a rare adrenal cancer and a genetic condition called Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. This means her daughter will always have an increased cancer risk, even after beating it in her first year of life. Lisa's breast cancer diagnosis increases her daughter's risk even more. Lisa has a lot on. She is building her life with her gorgeous daughter, is traveling hours every three months for her daughter's hospital visits, and constantly now for herself as well. Lisa does it all on her own - she has been unimaginably strong for her daughter as a single mother, and now Lisa needs our strength too. Being the sole parent to her daughter, these treatments, back and forth to hospitals, and many visits between her and her daughter are a massive financial burden. Lisa is not somebody who will ask for help - she has been strong enough. It would be a huge help if we can be strong for her and help her with these medical bills. Anything helps. If you don't know Lisa personally, please know that I do. She has overcome too much to drown in medical bills while undergoing treatment. Please, help us get Lisa healthy and back to being her badass self. ",4600,10000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/4ke4a2-faiths-fight,Faith’s Fight," Hey my names Micah!  My younger sister Faith has a long road ahead and her fight starts now. In 2017 Faith was diagnosed with a prolactinoma pituitary brain tumor. Oswald as we call it was presumed to be benign and not a cause for concern. As the years have passed her symptoms have progressively gotten worst, I will save you the details but long story short her body constantly produces prolactin which is a hormone the body produces while pregnant.  About a month ago she found 3 masses on her breast which had become painful. After an ER visit they decided on a biopsy, the larger of the 3 came back as cancer. Right then our entire world turned upside down, our 22 year old ray of sunshine has the “C” word.  Faith Has a ways to go, she has not been staged yet and there are so many unanswered questions. She already has multiple doctors appointments to come. We have not confirmed if the pituitary tumor is tied to her breast cancer but chances are it is. Our biggest fear is that the cancer is not only in her breast but through out her body.  The insurance situation has been hard since she is not able to work and medical bills will be rolling in by the dozen, anything you are able to spare will be greatly appreciated and will not go unnoticed. We lay this at the feet of our Lord and know that she will fight! Thank you for taking the time to read this far every thought and prayer counts.  ",2424,5000,6 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-fight-hunters-with-brooks,Help us fight Hunter Syndrome with Brooks!," Hi Friends & Family, Our sweet Brooks was diagnosed with a super rare genetic disorder called Hunter Syndrome in June 2021.  Hunter Syndrome (MPS II) is a rare genetic disease that affects less than 500 boys in the United States. These boys are missing an enzyme used to break down cellular waste. When that waste builds up, it leads to progressive damage throughout their little bodies. Some never develop speech, but some boys learn like a typical child then begin losing skills and what they’ve learned at a young age. They eventually lose the ability to walk, talk and eat. Most do not live to see their teen years. We are so grateful that Brooks was accepted into a medical trial at one of the best hospitals in the world for Hunter Syndrome: UNC Chapel Hill. To participate in the trial we need to relocate to North Carolina for the next 6 months.  I have been very lucky to be able to continue working full time remotely during the trial. Pete however has had to take a leave of absence from his job. This makes it impossible to continue our mortgage payments back in Maryland.  Any and all donations are much appreciated and will go directly to paying the bills in Fallston while we’re living in North Carolina.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/let-us-help-antoinette-cantrell,Let Us Help Antoinette Cantrell," Those of us blessed to know Antoinette Cantrell have quite likely been helped by her – because that is who she is, someone who helps everyone.  She and her husband, John, raised four biological children, cared for more than fifty foster children who lived with them over a span of seventeen years, provided day care and respite for infants and toddlers, and adopted five more children.  It was commonplace to see her out and about, common to hear her honk the horn of her twelve passenger van and wave her arm out the window exuberantly. “Hello! Call me!” she’d yell, her van full of car seats and children.  Even as we know how loving, feisty and strong Antoinette is, it’s especially hard to accept that she is suddenly fighting for her life.  In early October, the Cantrell family contracted Covid-19.  They quarantined, hunkered down, and everyone recovered, except Antoinette. Three weeks ago, Antoinette was admitted to Guthrie Hospital in Corning, New York with serious respiratory complications due to Covid-19.  Two weeks ago, she became critically ill and was transferred to the ICU where she was intubated and put on a ventilator. A day later, she was flown via Life Flight’s critical care helicopter to Rochester, New York and admitted to the ICU at Strong Memorial Hospital on full life support, fighting for her life.   John Cantrell only asks for prayers.  He feels the love and support of family, friends, and community and is so appreciative.  John is home caring for the younger kids, some of whom have disabilities.  Last week, John and Antoinette’s grown daughters organized a Care Calendar which has helped those of us who feel so helpless do something for them.  The Care Calendar organizes meals and housekeeping to help John. The community response has been wonderful – we’ve nearly filled the meal calendar through November, including Thanksgiving dinner.   The goal of this second campaign is to donate money directly to John Cantrell to relieve the surmounting financial strain of Antoinette’s medical care.  Any donation will help relieve the cost of Antoinette’s ongoing hospitalization and the financial stress radical illness brings with it.  Today, she continues to be on full life support, still on a ventilator, still sedated in the intensive care unit at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester.  Our support and generosity is a way to say thank you for everything John and Antoinette have done for us and for so many children in need, for Child and Family Services of Chemung County, for their church community and neighbors.  If you are able, please help Antoinette and John Cantrell during this time of need.  Any donation is heartfelt and appreciated. Go Fund Me sends all donations for Antoinette directly to John Cantrell.   https://images.app.goo.gl/6eN7ABCnT8G3bsuk8 ",2120,10000,1 day

""assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh, My name is Dahir Jigre. We are creating this GoFundMe page for my beautiful wife who was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. I have always hated the word cancer and the pain it brings to those we love. However, going through it and dealing with it is completely different, which my wife and anyone going through cancer can attest to. For those that know me best, I am not one to ask for things. Especially, when it comes to financial matters. Cancer has taught me to open my mouth and seek help wherever and whenever I can. That being said, we have learned that her breast cancer has metastasized and moved into a different part of her body, which is scary, terrifying, and hopelessly draining. Regardless of what may come, my wife and I have hope and faith that Allah (God) has a plan for all of us. We learned about Antineoplaston which has proven to work and maybe the answer that we seek. So please lend us a supporting hand to overcome this battle so my wife, our two beautiful little boys, and I can resume life before hearing of the word Cancer. PLEASE, find it in your heart to donate what you can, share and post on your social media platforms. THANK YOU."" All of the funds that are collected will be used to cover treatment and other expenses. We will keep you all updated along the way. No amount of Sadaqah is too small or too big. Sadaqah ( charity) will benefit you in this world and the hereafter in sha allah. In order for the doctor to start treatment, a deposit of $20,000 is needed. The treatment will cost $7,000 a month for  12 months. $120,000  is needed all together for the treatment. Although this is a lot of money, we have hope that with your help we will reach this goal. We ask that you make Duas (prayers) for my beautiful aunt during this difficult time.  I responsible for running this fundraiser and making sure that it is successful. In sha allah, with the help of Allah swt and your donation, we will reach the goal. Please share the link it with your friends, family and on  your social media platform.

Please contribute if you are able. Thank you for your time, for sending prayers and for your contribution.  Blessings, Maayan Here is a letter from Aphieme about her journey as of late: Dear friends, I find myself in a complicated situation that has been unfolding for about a year. I haven’t always known what to do, and even now I do not love every single option which has been presented to me. Please join me as I claim the best path I know how including a lot of holistic integration methods post-surgery. I have been diagnosed with a uterus full of fibroid (usually benign) tumors as well as one cystic/solid mass which they are not sure what it is or where exactly it is. The more images they’ve taken the longer the list of possible locations; uterine wall, ovary, perhaps in the peritoneum. This cystic/solid tumor they are concerned more that it could be, or could become, cancer. They insist that they just do not and cannot know until they open me up. They do not biopsy things in the pelvic bowl in case they would spread something. I’ve decided to have a laparoscopic surgery to remove the unknown mass as well as some of the larger fibroids. I’ve had unexplained pains for a very long time (20 years) in my pelvic bowl, feeling awkward, crooked, bloated, hip and low back pain, nerve pain, etc. For the last year I’ve been on a seriously deep dive of understanding female reproductive health, hormone balance, holistic methods, castor oil packs, v-steams, herb/supplement protocols, fasting methods, stress reduction, creative center clearing, grief work, acupuncture, energy work, and more. I am beyond blessed to be connected to a team of healers, and I feel prepared to integrate surgery as one of many methods I am imploring to transform at this stage in my journey of life. I am reaching out mostly to share my journey with you so you know you’re not alone in your own struggles, and in the instance that your or yours have similar struggles, and so you can keep me in your prayers. If you have some monetary support you’d like to offer, that is also very helpful. Please, as in all ways, only give from your abundance. The surgery will take place on November 8th at 12:30 in the afternoon if you’d like to light a candle or say a prayers for me at that time Love, Aphieme ",5220,10000,3 days

I was born in Caracas, Venezuela where I currently live along with my two college studying children, and today I'd like to share a situation I'm going through right now.Ten years ago I was diagnosed with a self immune disease called ulcerative rectocolitis. An incurable disease with an unknown origin.In the past years at least a dozen doctors have all agreed on the same veredict: a potential colon displacia, which is an abnormal growth of non carcinogen tissue and potentially a previous stage of cancer. Theremoval of my colon, which leads to the use of a colon waste bag and the negative consequences on my life style. The development of colon and rectum cancer.In the last years my symptoms have become more aggressive and long lasting. Theyappear more frequently and are harder to deal with. It has been deteriorating my health, causing physical and mental exhaustion, and weakness. I also have a malnourishment problem, and have to take supplements.I`ve been hospitalized multiple times, up to two and threes times a year, and I`ve had to receive blood transfusion many timesIn January I acontracted COVID-19 and I almost didn´t survived because my immune system has been affected by this disease.For the first time I've found an alternative, a sign of hope, at the anti aging clinic with DrJuan Carlos Méndez.They work with cellular regeneration treatment and mother cells treatment. They've offered me a cure for the first time.I've been working in the industry of financial counseling and service area, as an organization consultant.I've put all of the things that I've learned to help others. It's my life mission. A beautiful social service. I've been working with disadvantaged  teenagers that seek support from someone to improve their lives and don't know how. I've been accompanying them. I've guided young gang members, suicidal teenagers and potential killers. And I want to help them again.Unfortunately I've been bedridden for the past two months because the symptoms have become more aggressive and I've had to change my work style to a more independent way to do it, and I ended up losing my insurance. That's why I've come to you asking for help, for your aid. Whatever you can donate, no help is too little. Share this campaign with everyone you can get to, so it reaches more people.Also I'm going to be a grandma.I'm being supported by my family's and friends' loving hands, which puts me in a vulnerable position, but at the same time fills me with strength because I count on you and I know that I'm going to be alright.So, share the campaign, donate what you can and God bless you. VERSIÓN ESPAÑOLHola mi nombre es Marilyn Salazar, tengo 48 años, nací en Caracas Venezuela y actualmente vivo en Venezuela junto a mis dos hijos universitarios y hoy quiero compartir contigo una situación por la que estoy atravesando.Hace 10 años me diagnosticaron una enfermedad autoinmune llamada Rectocolitisulcerosa, es una enfermedad de la que no se conoce el origen y es incurable. En el transcurso de estos años al menos una docena de médicos coincidieron todos en el pronóstico: que puede generar una DISPLASIA DE COLON que es un crecimiento anormal del tejido, que no es cáncer pero puede ser un estadio previo al cáncer, EXTIRPARCIÓN DEL COLON, con lo cual tendría que usar una bolsa de desechos y el impacto que eso genera en la calidad de vida y desarrollar CANCER COLORECTAL.En los últimos años estas crisis se han vuelto más agresivas, más largas, entro más rápidamente en ellas, me cuesta más salir de ellas y esto ha venido generando un deterioro en general: agotamiento, físico, mental, debilitamiento, porque además tengo problemas de asimilación  y me tengo que suplementar. Me ha tenido que hospitalizar muchas veces, en ocasiones hasta 2 y 3 veces por año y me han tenido que hacer transfusiones de sangre en varias ocasiones.El pasado mes de enero me dio coronavirus y casi no sobrevivo al virus por causa de esta condición que tiene a mi sistema inmunológico muy afectado.Por primera vez he encontrado una alternativa, una esperanza en la clínica anti envejecimiento con el doctor Juan Carlos Méndez, ellos trabajan con medicina regenerativa, con medicina celular, con células madre y me han hablado de una curación por primera vez.Yo he venido desempeñándome laboralmente en el área de servicios en asesoría a empresas en el área financiera, como consultora organizacional y todo lo que he aprendido lo que he puesto al servicio de mi misión de vida que es un trabajo social que he venido haciendo con jóvenes adolescentes de bajos recursos que están buscando el apoyo de alguien, que quieren echar para adelante y no saben cómo hacerlo. Los he venido acompañando, he tenido historias con muchachos que han formado parte de bandas delictivas, con pensamientos suicidas o con pensamientos homicidas y yo quiero volver a estar al servicio de éstos jóvenes, de estos muchachos.Lamentablemente tengo 2 meses parada incapacitada con mucho debilitamiento porque la enfermedad se ha vuelto muy agresiva y he tenido que migrar a formas más independientes de trabajo, con lo cual me he quedado sin seguro en el proceso. Por eso vengo hoy a ti a pedirte tu ayuda, a pedirte que por favor aportes lo que sea posible para ti, no hay aporte pequeño, que compartas la campaña con personas que conozcas, de manera que cada vez sean más personas que puedan hacer estos aportes.Además voy a ser abuela y en este momento estoy siendo sostenida por las amorosas manos de mi familia, amigos y allegados, esto me coloca en una situación de mucha vulnerabilidad, de mucha fragilidad pero a la vez de mucha fortaleza porque cuento con tu solidaridad y sé que voy a salir adelante, así que por favor comparte la campaña, aporta lo que esté en tus manos y que Dios te bendiga, muchas gracias!.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/todos-por-rosalba,Todos por Rosalba!," ¡Hola!. Mi nombre es Rosalba Tumino, y me han diagnosticado  con Cancer . Yo vivo en Venezuela, casada y con dos hijos que en estos momentos de mi vida deberia estar para ayudar y apoyar a mis hijos durante la etapa de transición académica universitaria y acompañarlos en sus sueños de convertirse en profesionales útiles y comprometidos. Pero en estos momentos, he pasado a ser un número más en las estadísticas de un tipo de cáncer poco común. A principios de agosto, fuertes dolores abdominales, escalofríos y vómitos me obligan a acudir a servicios médicos de emergencias. Los médicos temiendo una peritonitis o isquemia de colon, deciden operarme. Después de la operación, en la que retiran mi colon derecho, y después de varias biopsias y estudios inmunohistoquímicos, me diagnostican adenocarcinoma peritoneal ST IIIC. Debido a que nuestro seguro decidió rescindir de la póliza luego de conocer el tipo de cáncer que padezco, a lo difícil que resulta recibir atención en hospitales por la cantidad de pacientes oncológicos en listas de espera y a la recomendación de iniciar lo antes posible el tratamiento, por lo avanzado del cáncer; decidimos comenzar el tratamiento en clínicas privadas, siendo sin lugar a dudas, la decisión más acertada. No obstante, los costos son extremadamente altos y con mucho esfuerzo hemos podido cubrir una pequeña parte del costo estimado de todo el tratamiento. Los doctores que atienden mi caso me han manifestado su optimismo, a raíz del progreso favorable que se ha visto con solo los primeros dos ciclos de quimioterapia, de las seis que están programadas. Sus palabras me llenan de esperanza. Pronto estaremos realizando la cirugía de citorreducción para remover nódulos tumorales del peritoneo. Con mucha fe, esperanza en Dios, de la mano de los doctores y la medicina moderna, estoy segura que superaré esta fase del tratamiento. Después de la operación se harán otros estudios para evaluar los resultados y comenzar nuevos ciclos de inmunoterapia, para culminar el tratamiento. Para conseguir cubrir los altos costos que esta dura lucha exige y lograr vencer, es necesario recaudar la suma de $40.000 USD, que serán utilizados para el pago de quimioterapias, cirugía, exámenes, tomografías, colonoscopias, inmunoterapia y otros exámenes necesarios para control y seguimiento del progreso. Cualquier cantidad de dinero que pueda aportar será bienvenido y me estará ayudando a lograr vencer esta enfermedad. Les aseguro que no me rendiré y, junto con ustedes , pondré fin a este difícil capítulo de mi vida. ¡¡No me rendiré!! ____________________________________ Hello! My name is Rosalba Tumino and I have been diagnosed with Cancer. I live in Venezuela, married and with two children that in these moments of their life need my help during their university academic transition stage and my support in their dreams of becoming useful and committed professionals. But unfortunately, I recently became part of the statistics of people with cancer. At the beginning of August, severe abdominal pain, chills and vomiting forced me to go to emergency medical services. The doctors, fearing peritonitis or colon ischemia, decided to operate on me. After the operation, in which my right colon was removed, and after several biopsies and immunohistochemical studies, I was diagnosed with ST IIIC peritoneal adenocarcinoma. Due to the fact that our insurance decided to terminate the policy after knowing the type of cancer I suffer from, and the great difficulties in receiving care in hospitals due to the number of cancer patients on waiting lists, and the doctors’ recommendation to start treatment as soon as possible due to the advanced stage of the cancer, we decided to start the treatment in a private clinic, which resulted in the best decision we could take. However, the costs are extremely high and with much effort we have only been able to cover a small portion of the estimated cost of the entire treatment. The doctors who treat my case have expressed optimism following the favorable progress and results they have seen after the first two cycles of chemotherapy out of the six that are scheduled. Their words fill me with great hope. The doctors soon will be operating on me again to remove tumor nodules from the peritoneum. With great hope and faith in God, hand in hand with doctors and modern medicine, I am sure that I will overcome this phase of the treatment. After the operation, other studies will be done to evaluate the results and start new cycles of immunotherapy, to complete the treatment. To be able to cover the high costs that this hard fight demands, it is necessary to raise the sum of $ 40,000 USD, which will be used to pay for chemotherapy, surgery, examinations, tomography, colonoscopy and immunotherapy to control and monitor progress. Any amount of money that you can contribute will be welcome and will be helping me to overcome this disease. I assure you that I will not give up and, together with you, I will put an end to this difficult chapter of my life. I will not give up!! Thank you very much. ",4543,40000,4 days

Kay is a 24 year old Black femme who has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Kay sought medical guidance from over 5 different doctors over the past year but unfortunately found that her needs were dismissed repeatedly, leaving her undiagnosed and scared. Determined for answers, she kept fighting and finally her concerns were heard. Kay is fortunately insured, however, the out of pocket costs are already creating financial hardship for Kay and her family, and treatment has not yet begun. Kay has not been able to work her normal hours due to the mental and physical distress that this is causing her as well. The funds raised here will be used to pay the remaining balance for surgery and radiation and to cover living expenses (rent/food/etc.) for the next 5-8 weeks while Kay recovers from treatment. This will also help set Kay up with mental health services to cope with her increased anxiety. Any left over funds will be distributed to mutual aid. We understand this is a difficult time for almost everyone financially so any contribution would be appreciated. If you can’t contribute, sharing this to help us meet the goal would be appreciated.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/helping-brad-and-renee-focus-on-the-fight,Helping Brad and Renee focus on the fight," As most everyone knows our best friends are going through a really rough time. Brad was diagnosed with colon cancer in October of last year, he battled cancer until May 2021 and won his fight. This October two more spots were found. Brad was diagnosed with metastatic stage four colon cancer, he started his fight on October 26th with three intense chemo medicines, all at one time. Brad is very positive with this fight, that we will beat it once again, but there is much more on his mind. Brad works at John Deere and they have been on strike for weeks. The strike pay is so much less than normal pay or even WI. Renee is in the medical field and has used most of her PTO from the previous cancer fight this year. So anytime she takes off, beyond her PTO would be unpaid. Both Brad and Renee need to focus their fight with kicking cancers butt and not paying the house payment or worrying if they can pay the co-pay to get the chemo treatment. In two months, Brad will have another scan to see if the chemo is working, if it is, he will continue maintenance chemo the rest of his life. Bryan and I have had several people reach out to us in what they can do to help. We are hoping we can all pitch in and take care of some monthly bills and co-pays so they can focus on more important things like kicking cancers butt once again. If you are not able to donate money, please know you can always make a pot of soup or pan of food, we all know Renee hates to cook.  Brad has taken the green flag in the biggest race of the year, there will be some pitstops, and some struggles along the way, but I think I can speak for everyone here, we will all be in Victory Lane, waiting for him to take the checkered. We cannot thank you all enough for the positivity and prayers as we fight this battle once again. ",2290,5000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/5nyree-my-sister-my-hero,"My Sister, My Hero"," Hi, my name is Mandi Garrett. I am fundraising for Kelli Henry. My sister Kelli is my hero. With selflessness, love and determination she has overcome enormous trials in her past and created a beautiful home and a family that is constantly looking outward and finding ways to lift and serve wherever they are needed. Unfortunately, now she is facing a new trial that has affected her ability to be with and work with them in the same way she has in the past. Kelli has always considered being a mom to be the most important and most fulfilling work a woman can perform in this life. It is because of her that her six boys and only daughter have grown up to be the bright, caring people they are today. We’re hoping that with your help Kelli can continue to receive the medical care she needs to be with and strengthen her family for a long time to come. Let me tell you her story and you can decide if there’s anything you can do to help:   Kelli Henry was infected with Covid in late August 2021. She was 37 weeks pregnant. After suffering for 10 days in isolation with the effects of Covid and not getting any better she was taken to the hospital and was promptly swept away by a nurse, leaving behind a bewildered and frightened husband wondering what in the world was going to happen to his wife. After several worried hours he was informed she would be staying in the hospital because she had a very bad case of pneumonia and her prognosis was not good.   The next day, as she struggled to breath, Kelli had an emergency c-section. She was all alone because no one was allowed to be with her. She was given a quick glimpse of her perfectly healthy brand new baby boy before they were to be separated for weeks! In the days that followed, Kelli continued struggling and fighting for her life because of all the fluid in her lungs and a failing heart. Then, through nothing short of a miracle, Kelli pulled through! After a couple of weeks, and even though she was still very sick, she was able to leave the hospital and hold her baby for the first time and hug all her children and wonderful husband.   Fast forward to today: Kelli still requires the assistance of oxygen on a regular basis. She still has fluid in her lungs and her heart is weak. She relies on help from family members including her husband who owns and operates a small business and our parents who do what they can to help with everyday tasks. She is slowly recovering but cannot move freely on her own. She will require a lot more help as she works her way towards a normal daily routine.    Kelli is so lucky to have a very loving, hard working husband that is willing to do anything for her and their children. He does absolutely everything he can to protect and provide for his family, working long into the night while juggling work and parenting responsibilities. At the same time, our parents have so kindly opened their home to all nine of the Henrys to make sure they have daily support including getting kids to and from school and extracurricular activities, feeding them, doing laundry and every other chore that a large family demands while providing a loving place to call home. Still, it has become increasingly clear that more helping hands will be required at this time of need. It will be a long road but with proper medical care and A LOT of help Kelli has hope of a full recovery! My sister is not one to ask for help. That is why I am setting up this GoFundMe for her. I am asking that you donate to help with Kelli’s steadily mounting medical bills along with helping out with the added cost to our parents of having nine extra people to take care of in one home. Please help me support my hero, my sister and my best friend so we can keep her around for a long, long time to come! Thank you. ",3380,12000,4 days

The past few days has been, in a word, terrifying. To see Tim go from a healthy happy young man to fighting for his life has shocked us all. Tim is a fighter. He loves his wife and daughter with every fiber of his being. Having lost our Dad at a young age, it means everything to him to be there for his daughter. He's deeply loved by his family, his friends and just about anyone who ever met him. For many of us, he's the kindest and funniest person we know.  It's impossible to know right now what the road to recovery looks like in duration, prognosis or long term issues. Right now, we're focusing on right now as Tim's body works hard to heal.  So many people have reached out to us to offer prayers, well wishes, support, love and offers of help. We appreciate every one of you, from the bottoms of our hearts. Please keep us in your thoughts, send us your love, your prayers, your energy and good thoughts. I also humbly ask, that if you can contribute to this fund to do so. If cannot, please keep that support and love coming and share this on all the platforms. We will continue to provide updates on Tim's condition here. Thank you all and I love you. Please, love each other. ****Update**** This is a terribly slow process. I will try to give more frequent updates. It's a whirlwind of ups and downs. As I said, it's a slow process. Tim's body is working hard. Keep the love an prayers coming. As for updates on the family- Can I tell you that Grace is an absolute Queen?  She's been having to work (she's an amazing teacher if you didn't know). She splits her time between work, the hospital and taking care of Emerson.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/jillys-radiation-treatment,Marguerite Ellis' (AKA  Jilly's) Treatment," Hi, I'm Sabrina Henry, one of Jilly's younger sisters. This is the last thing I ever thought our family would've had to resort to doing. We are aware that gofundme is not insurance and so after we have explored all other avenues and with little to no success, we decided to try this forum. Each time I supported a gofundme I silently hoped I would never ever have to do one; but life happens and reality hits. I always know those families who did one had little to no choice as they aimed to help their loved ones.  Our sister, Jilly was diagnosed with breast cancer last December. She had done her annual mammogram in October, but then found a lump under her arm which was later found to be cancer. She has already completed her operation in January and completed chemotherapy a few weeks ago. Her insurance company covered some of the cost of those, but now she has to start radiation treatment and it is seriously hard to come up with all of the payment at once.  The total cost printed and handed to her from her doctor/treatment center is $20, 045US ($3,006,750.00JA). Her insurance company is only covering $500,000.00JA which is roughly only $3,200U.S. This means that she needs to come up with the balance which is $2.5 million Jamaican dollars which is roughly ($17,000US). (P.S. Gofundme will take fees from whatever is donated). When she expressed to us that she will not do the treatment because she cannot afford it, it broke our hearts and we begged her to allow us to explore other avenues. We have depleted a lot of our savings and friends along with herself have been spending all we have to aid in her road to recovery.  We are staying strong in our hopes to have her spend as much time on Earth with us as is possible. If it's in your heart to help, please do. We will be extremely grateful for any amount toward this goal. She's not happy about having to do this, but we are motivating her to believe and accept that sometimes in life we all have to lean on each other one way or another. Thank you and we promise to share her recovery story, because she WILL! From all of us. Thank you.  ",6052,16000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-andy-receive-necessary-care,Please Help Andy Goldfarb Receive Necessary Care,"Team fundraiserDebra Romeo and Anna Rottke are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Andy Goldfarb. Big Cat Keeper Andy Goldfarb needs our help! Andy Goldfarb spent a lifetime caring for big cats, and now Andy himself is in need of care. For over 35 years Andy dedicated his life to the care and conservation of wild animals, and assisted in the birth, hand-feeding and rearing of over 100 wild animal cubs including endangered Sumatran tigers and clouded leopards. His astonishing career took him to zoos and animal sanctuaries all over the world, from California, to Australia, to Thailand and beyond, where he worked tirelessly to conserve big cats. Now, at the age of 58, Andy suffers from an aggressive type of Young Onset Alzheimer’s disease that has rendered him not only unable to work with the animals he loves but unable to  just take care of his own daily living needs. He isn’t just a cat person.  Andy is a people person, too. He has trained and mentored countless zookeepers and wild animal specialists, always with a smile and an easy-going manner. He even reached across cultural boundaries to build long-time friendships with keepers in Thailand as he poured his heart into a ground breaking clouded leopard breeding program there. After such a storied and incomparable career, forging lifelong connections with humans and animals everywhere he goes, Andy is more than a zookeeper, conservationist, wild animal lover. He is a legend. And he deserves care on par with what he gave to his beloved tigers and clouded leopards for so many years. Though he was working as a zookeeper as recently as January of 2020, Andy’s Young Onset Alzheimer’s disease has progressed so rapidly that he now needs help with daily tasks as simple as dressing and bathing. Andy struggles to communicate due to also having logopenic primary progressive aphasia, a very rare neurological syndrome, and experiences deep anxiety when Maureen, his wife of 29 years, goes to work. Andy wants to remain in his home with Maureen - where he is comfortable and surrounded by reminders of his extraordinary life - for as long as possible. On the walls of his home hang framed portraits of Andy’s most beloved animal, a tiger named Rakhan. Even long after Rakhan’s passing, Andy still speaks of his best friend “Rocky” with misty eyes. These are the memories that slip away from Andy every day. The cost of in-home care is devastating. One year of care will cost over $80,000 dollars, far more than what Maureen’s zookeeper salary will provide. We can’t stop Alzheimer’s.  But what we can do is give Andy the love and care he needs to live out the remainder of his extraordinary life as best he can. Andy’s contribution to the populations of tigers, clouded leopards and other big cats in zoos and in the wild all over the planet is incalculable. Now, it’s our turn to give Andy Goldfarb the attention he deserves. He and Maureen need our help. They will be truly grateful for any support you can give. Please share Every small donation can make a big difference so please help spread the word by sharing Andy’s Go Fund Me. ",83875,80000,7-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jeremy-a-24-year-military-vet-fight-cancer,"Help Jeremy, a 24 year Military Vet, Fight Cancer","Jason and Jody Smart is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jeremy Smart. Our brother, Jeremy Smart, is fighting a battle no one should have to fight – the fight against Stage 4 Colon / Liver Cancer. Jeremy is a father to four beautiful kids, a husband to Maryanne, a son, a brother, and a friend. He is a military veteran that served 24 years and completed two tours of duty in Iraq. He has spent his life in service to others. He continues to this day to mentor those he served alongside throughout active and reserve duty and with whom he has formed deep and lasting friendships. About a month ago, Jeremy started experiencing bouts of stomach pain, and through a diagnostic colonoscopy, a large mass was found in his colon. Subsequent scans showed that it had also spread to his liver. He recently underwent a successful colectomy to remove the mass and part of his colon. It was not an easy surgery. Due to the mass' location and subsequent complications, the doctors could not use the laparoscopic technique. They had to go at it, in the doctor's words, "" old school"". He now has a nice scar from his sternum to his waistline as he recovers at home. The recovery has been difficult and is still ongoing, but he is working hard to regain his strength to begin the next step of his fight. After surgery, Jeremy and Maryanne spoke with their oncologist and found out he will be going through chemotherapy treatments at MD Anderson in Houston and having additional surgeries on his liver to remove the cancer spots. This will all be followed up by further treatments of chemotherapy. The whole process is estimated to take the better part of a year. As you can imagine, this has been devastating news for Jeremy, Maryanne, the kids, and our family. None of us know what the next year will hold, but we have a plan and are ready to stand beside our brother and fight. We have started this GoFundMe account to ease the burden of this battle. Over the following days, weeks, months, and year ahead, there are many more tests, hospital stays, travel, hotel and living expenses at MD Anderson, and days missed from work for Maryanne and Jeremy. He will be in the hospital for undetermined amounts of time. As you can imagine, the standard costs of everyday living, such as home, food, gas, car, with added medical, travel and hotel costs can be astronomical. This account will enable Jeremy and Maryanne to concentrate on getting Jeremy well and fighting this horrible disease. Many of you know that Jeremy is the kindest soul you will ever meet. He is humble, private, and proud. It was all we could do to get him to agree to this. He has always made sure others' needs are met before his own and now is our chance to repay him as we rally together in this fight. From the bottom of our hearts, we humbly ask that you share this link with friends and family, and if possible, in giving. Any amount will help.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-ava-grace-beat-the-odds-teamavagrace,Help Ava Grace Beat the Odds #TeamAvaGrace," Ava Grace Chandler was born on Tuesday, September 28th at 10:28 AM. She has an incredibly rare genetic condition called Kagami-Ogata Syndrome (KOS), also known at UPD14, which involves a random mutation of her 14th chromosome. There are only 81 cases documented worldwide, now including her. She’s been intubated and in the NICU since she was born. Ava Grace has multiple challenges, the biggest of which is musculoskeletal abnormalities that make it very hard for her to breathe. She has “coat-hanger” ribs, which are unusually small and sharp, restricting the size of her lungs; she has an abdominal wall defect that makes it hard for her to do the mechanical work of breathing (she might be missing her ab muscles on one side); and she has dystonia, which is generalized muscle weakness that makes her tire out easily when she moves at all, including to breathe. She will also likely have developmental and learning challenges; she only has one kidney; she has trouble swallowing and has a feeding tube; she has multiple joint contractures, including in her hands; she has severe scoliosis; she has shortened arms and legs; and she produces large amounts of thick mucosal secretions which make breathing and swallowing even more difficult. KOS babies often do not survive past their first week of life, so she has already defied the odds. In fact, Ava Grace is making a habit of teaching us new things every day. Because this condition is so rare, we don’t know what her long-term outcomes will be for sure. We do know that making it to her 5th birthday is a magic mark for longer-term survivability, but that she will require substantial support as long as we are blessed to have her. She has taken on several nicknames already: Sweet Pea, Squishy, Bubble Guppy (for the secretions), and our Unicorn. Her older brother Jack and older sister Cece love her very much. They are processing all of this in their own way, which has brought its own set of challenges. Prior to Ava Grace’s arrival, Tonya had several large obstacles of her own to overcome. In April, at 12 weeks pregnant and before we knew about the KOS, Tonya’s appendix burst. Because pregnancy limits the kind of imaging that can be done, the rupture went undetected for about a day and a half. During that time, she developed peritonitis and was on the verge of sepsis when it was caught. She had surgery to remove it and clean out the infection in her abdominal cavity. She came through and so did Ava Grace. Tough Mom, tough baby. A few days after we left the hospital, we went to get a non-invasive genetic test to check for more common genetic syndromes like Trisomy 21. The test came back inconclusive, which was our first clue that something was off. We went to get an ultrasound and saw multiple soft markers for Downs Syndrome. We made an appointment with a genetic specialist to follow up. At first, we were told it was likely Trisomy 18, which is fatal. We were crushed. To be sure, we opted for an amniocentesis. Then, the first genetic test, called the FISH, came back normal, ruling out all the trisomies. Then her karyotype, or full chromosomal scan, came back looking normal. We were cautiously optimistic that there had been a mistake, that Tonya’s surgery had somehow thrown off the genetic tests. The final step was to send the amnio, and samples of Tonya and my DNA, to a specialty genetics lab in Montana for a micro-array analysis. We waited for the results with some hope. The results came back clearly indicating KOS / UPD14. Thankfully, it was the random mutation variety, meaning that I wasn’t a carrier, and we didn’t have to get Jack and Cece tested as carriers. We were transferred from Brookwood to UAB for care, since we knew the rest of the pregnancy would be especially difficult. One of the difficulties with the pregnancy was severe polyhydramnios – an over-accumulation of amniotic fluid. Tonya quickly looked like she was carrying full-term twins, even in the second trimester. It made it hard for her to breathe and sleep. We had an amnioreduction, but the fluid came back within days. At that point, we were weighing a C-section and potential prematurity with Tonya’s safety and the challenge of a spontaneous birth since Ava Grace would require so much support immediately. Miraculously, we made it to 37 weeks. The C-section went smoothly, but Ava Grace was non-responsive when she was born with Apgar scores of 0 across the board. They did mechanical ventilation until she could be intubated a few minutes later. 29 days later, here we are. We do not know when we will get to take her home, but we’re hopeful. She has already shown us so much. We are very lucky to have insurance, but even with that coverage we have medical bills that are due immediately. This GoFundMe will help cover that substantial gap, help us pay for downtown parking at UAB (we are at the NICU everyday), help pay for specialty equipment that Ava Grace will need when we take her home, and help cover childcare for Jack and Cece when needed. Thank you so much for your love and support. We all feel it deeply. Go #TeamAvaGrace! ",8500,10000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/jake-thibeault-needs-our-support,Jake Thibeault needs our support!,"Kevin Lizotte is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Michael Thibeault. Jake wanted to give everyone a quick update.... ""Today I was able to sit up with the support of the wonderful healthcare team, here in Worcester.  I'm going to fight this fight like hell, the road is going to be long but because of each and every one of you, it makes it a little bit easier""        Hi Everyone, My name is Kevin Lizotte . This fundraising effort is in honor of Jake Thibeault. As many of you know, Jake was involved in a hockey related accident resulting in a spinal cord injury. I first met Jake and his family over a decade ago when he first played on the Blues Leominster Dek Hockey team with my son. A few years later, I had the privilege of coaching him in ice hockey for seven years on the Worcester Junior Railers and on various dek hockey teams. Jake played for Twin City Youth Hockey, Fitchburg High School, The Boston Bulldogs, South Shore Kings and various other travel teams. Currently Jake is attending Milton Academy in Milton, MA where he plays ice hockey as a Milton Mustang. For those of you who know Jake, whether it be from hockey, school, the farm where he worked or the gym where he trains, you know that my words will never accurately capture Jake's full character. He is so much bigger than words. For those who don't know Jake, let me try. What makes Jake an outstanding hockey player has less to do with skills and skating and so much more to do with character. Jake is among the most dedicated, hard working student athletes. He has more grit and perseverance than most 18 year old's. Most importantly, he is the ultimate teammate. He's the first to pass the puck to set up a perfect scoring opportunity for teammate and the first kid to provide backup if someone is disrespecting his team. He is positive and encouraging to others both on and off the ice. Off the ice, he's the first to hold the door and the last to order his meal. He embodies the Milton Mustang's motto ""Dare to be true."" He is a true gentleman, a true athlete, a true student, a true teammate, and a true friend. Join me and the many others who know and love Jake in supporting Jake and his family with these fundraising efforts. All money raised will go toward Jake's rehabilitation needs , housing construction, and various medical costs and expenses. Thank you, in advance, for your generosity and support.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/makayla-kidney-transplant-medical-expenses,Makayla Kidney Transplant and Medical Expenses," Hello I'm Mark Angell and I'm fundraising for my amazing and beautiful niece, Makayla Szarko. Makayla is only 13 years old and requires two new kidneys. At 12 years of age, this wonderful human being was diagnosed with Nephrotic Syndrome and had to travel from Rhode Island to Boston weekly for medical assistance. After a few months, her amazing medical teams in Boston diagnosed her with an aggressive form of Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) - requiring dialysis three days a week in Boston to keep her alive. Makayla and our family are asking for your prayers and donations as Makayla is scheduled to have her kidneys removed on November 2nd, 2021. After a few months, she will be put on a kidney donation list and we are hopeful that her new kidney will come quickly. However, all of the medical and travel expenses to Boston (parking/gas/food in hospital, etc.) have financially crippled the Szarko family - even with some forgiveness from the medical community. Worsening the situation is the families inability to work a full time job due to the commuting times to Boston weekly - neither parent has received a full time paycheck since 2019. The greater concern is that the worst of the medical expenses have not even started - so your donation to this wonderful, kind, caring and truly sweet little girl would make a world of difference to her and her family. We appreciate you taking the time to read this and we appreciate your donations and at the very least please keep this special soul in your prayers as she is going to have a painful and truly challenging road ahead. God bless you all and thank you on behalf of the Angell and Szarko families! All donations will go towards medical bills, travel and support for Makayla as she navigates this challenging time. We are confident this strong little girl will fight through these challenges and lead a long, fruitful life with your support!   ",8990,250000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/andrews-heart-surgery-recovery,Andrew's Heart Surgery & Stroke Recovery," On October 8, 2021, Andrew Morgan, our beloved son, brother, grandson, and friend, was urgently taken to the hospital. He had a bloodstream infection along with heart and kidney failure that nearly cost him his life. They weren't sure he was going to make it. Andrew was born with a congenital heart condition and is a survivor of two open heart surgeries before the age of 2. The infection he got in October 2021 was a common respiratory bacteria that went into his blood stream and invaded his heart, necessitating him to undergo open heart surgery to replace 2 heart valves, repair a third valve, as well as repair a hole the size of a quarter in his heart. He suffered a stroke from the infected material in his heart that traveled to his brain which left him with visual impairments and short-term memory loss. He also had a septic emboli (clot of infection) travel to his foot preventing him from being able to stand or walk for weeks. He is now just starting to take a few steps. Thankfully, Andrew's rock star team of cardiac surgeons and specialists at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona were able to successfully complete the surgery and he has started a months-long road to recovery. He will be discharged from the hospital in late October and be moved to inpatient neuro-visual rehab and then to cardiac rehab. Andrew is a fighter and has lived a healthy and productive life, even with all the medical interventions he has weathered over the past 35 years. We are confident that he will embrace this next phase of recovery with his ever-present humor and positive attitude, which he has already demonstrated and amazed his medical team with so far. But we also know his recovery won't be easy. Andrew won't be able to work for several months and there may be lasting health impacts that he will need to navigate, including possible visual and physical impairments. The best chance for recovery is for him to focus his energy on intensive rehab/physical therapy. At this point he can't qualify for federal disability because the doctors aren't able to say if his disability will be longer than 12 months. Unfortunately, Andrew’s job at a startup company was eliminated a few months ago due to funding constraints. He has been doing some consulting on a per project basis and does not currently have any projects in the queue. He has been living off severance as he looks for new opportunities. He is determined to start working again soon, but at this point his health is the priority. Andrew has the best support system of family and friends who are chipping in financially, emotionally, and physically to help with his recovery. But unfortunately, he will need more financial assistance than what we are able to provide. A financial gift will allow Andrew to pay living and medical expenses over the next few months as he recovers, and get a visual therapist to hopefully regain enough of his eyesight to read and drive. Everyone who is lucky enough to know Andrew knows that he will embrace this journey with all of his incredible strength, determination, humor, positivity, and love. Thank you for supporting his recovery. We are deeply grateful for the offers of support and the generosity of those in our lives With gratitude, Amy (mom), Andrew, and the rest of the Andrew Morgan fan club ",15690,25000,5 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-this-family-fight-an-eating-disorder,Help This Family Fight An Eating Disorder," This is my friend, Amanda Moreno Duke's, teenage daughter.  She was hospitalized at MUSC Shawn Jenkins for a month in January of 2021 with a severe eating disorder; she almost died at that time.  It was terrifying.  After that first month, the medical team found it necessary to transfer her to a residential eating disorder facility.  Due to COVID restrictions, Amanda, a single mother, and a teacher was unable to see her daughter for 106 days.  It was a gut-wrenching time.  It was not until her daughter was stepped down and placed into a partial hospitalization that Amanda was able to be reunited with her daughter in Atlanta. Unfortunately, Amanda's daughter lapsed soon thereafter.  After another month or so at Children's in Atlanta, her daughter's medical team thought it would be best for Amanda to drive her daughter to a well-respected eating disorder facility in Dallas, Texas that allowed visitation and family involvement, so Amanda stayed despite FMLA and Catastrophic leave having been exhausted.  Amanda and her daughter have now been in Dallas for eight weeks.  However, Amanda's daughter is still very far from recovery. Money has run out, and health insurance benefits will too unless Amanda participates in COBRA.  Amanda has been told by her school district that COBRA will cost $750/month.  Because Amanda is still under contract and the district is not willing to sever that contract, she's unable to teach either virtually or in-person in a different district.  Even if she could, family meetings and therapy at the facility require her participation for 20 hours per week.  Soon her daughter will step down to partial hospitalization, which will then demand even more of Amanda's time.  Without continued insurance, Amanda's daughter will have to stop treatment.  Given her slow recovery, odds are that she could become a statistic:  one of those with anorexia nervosa who die every single hour ",6296,9600,7 days

A lot of you may not know, but my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer on 04/24/2018. It was a very difficult time for her loved ones to see such a strong woman with no history of breast cancer in the family get this horrible disease. We experienced her go through all the traumas a woman could go through. She felt mutilated after undergoing her breast mastectomy on 05/07/2018. Her insurance wouldn't cover all her medical costs, and she was not eligible for Medicaid. She had to pay $2,800 out of pocket for her breast removal surgery. She had to remain with one breast for over a year due to her financial situation. To this day, she has not done the nipple reconstruction and tattoo because she doesn't see it as a necessity. I offered to make her a GoFundMe page back then but she refused. She was never one to accept money from other people. She has always been a hard-working woman and worked during all that time. We thought the worst was over and the battle had been won. On November 27th, 2020, the day of my birthday, I received the worst possible news; she got diagnosed again with cancer but, this time, it had metastasized to her lungs. She finally got on disability, but, unfortunately, she only can receive 50% of her income. Without the help of Medicaid and making half of what she used to earn, she can barely cover the costs of all her medical expenses. She is paying $937 monthly on her insurance premium, and her out-of-pocket costs for PET scan and imaging is $600; not to mention each follow up visit to her oncologist costs $50. As if things couldn't get much worse, in mid-October 2021, they found another tumor. It's with a heavy heart that I am asking  for any help possible. It's not fair that a woman who has worked her entire life get turned down for medical assistance when she needs it most. She is in fear of losing her home because all her medical bills are piling up. I can't see her struggle like this and not do anything about it. I feel so impotent not being able to do more for her. I hope you see it in your heart to help my mom. Some of you may know her and some may not. For those that don't, she's my everything and I don't want to lose her. ",2425,25000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/move-nancy-home,Move Nancy Home," My sister, Nancy Hartings, is not able to move out of the nursing home or find a job due to a combination of health issues and staff shortages. Nancy's condition has declined such that she now basically requires one-on-one care most of the day. Unfortunately, nursing homes simply are not equipped to provide this level of care. Staffing is not available for her to move back home. Staffing is not available to accompany her to work. Thus she cannot work. As a result, Nancy's opportunities are truly limited. For the past 6 months she has spent roughly 10 hours of each day alone with nothing to do. This has only accelerated her health decline. I am raising money to help Nancy hire a personal assistant at a lucrative salary in order to improve Nancy's quality of life while living at the nursing home. This person will engage in the community, seek out employment and other enrichment activities, engage with family, set up visits with friends and family, etc.  Things that will help Nancy establish a routine and find a will to live again.    Nancy has led a hard life, impacted by a traumatic brain injury in 1981. She has come upon even tougher times recently. There are so many things working against her. Nancy's a strong woman, but she's hit a real rough spot and at times is even losing the will to keep going. If Nancy has impacted your life in any way, please consider a large donation that will support a better quality of life for Nancy's remaining years.  The money raised here will be paired with substantial funds from the Hartings Family.  Won't it be great when Nancy sees how many people love and support her.

We started the same week, bonding throughout our orientation together almost 4 years ago. Our work careers have overlapped over the years at various companies resulting in many shared friends. Ryan is the person that makes everyone laugh going out of his way to make others feel heard. Personally, he has supported me through work ""reorgs"", and COVID. He is a true light on our team. I do not know how I would have made it through without his sense of humor and perspective. A couple of months ago, Ryan called and let me know he was having some ""odd"" back and stomach pain. In effort to stay optimistic, we attempted to diagnose his issues with a gamete of ""easy to fix"" options. His intuition made him feel it was a bigger concern. After several weeks, he was finally diagnosed with a rare liver cancer affecting only 8,000 people per year. The cancer is not an easy one as he will need multiple chemotherapy regimens and surgery. Fortunately, has been accepted to a trial at OHSU. . Ryan is now preparing to fight for his life. Ryan is married to Justin Abitua, and they are parents to 2 adorable Australian Shepherds in Portland, Oregon. To better understand Ryan, with each conversation Ryan is more concerned with how his treatment and illness will affect everyone else, his husband, dogs, family and friends. His worries grow as COVID presents with additional challenges. He will not be able to be around his loved ones as his immune system decreases with treatment. He is preparing for what challenges are ahead as the medical bills start to arrive. Ryan will be needing equipment not covered by insurance like air purifiers, sit to stand recliner, care for his dogs, various transports and care. There are many considerations we do not think of not covered by insurance. He is worried the course could take a turn in which they would need to sell their home. The thought of Ryan suffering makes me so sad. Ryan is always thinking of others, putting others first and making people smile. An example that Ryan has shared is his love to throw a dinner party and find the perfect food for his guests just to see them happy. He is so proud of Justin and the life they have built. He adores his dogs and treats them like children. He worries about them and his sensitive heart is so full. So this go fund me page is an ask to help my dear wonderful friend Ryan to fight for his life. The goal is to help take some of the burden and worry away for a person that carries a lot on his shoulders as a consequence of his empathetic compassionate nature. During this month of cancer awareness, I ask that you give what ever little bit you can to help my friend. ",28160,35000,26-Sep-21

Allysha, Michelle, Stephen, and Emily have decided to come together to create a GoFundMe for our father, Gary. On October 3rd, Gary was confirmed to have Covid, and for the next several days, he was taken to the Emergency room in Little Falls. He was put on a ventilator on October 19th. On October 23rd, his condition declined and was airlifted to St. Cloud Hospital. He was also diagnosed with Covid pneumonia, blood clots in his chest,  pneumothorax, and a very weak immune system with heavily damaged lungs. He still remains on a ventilator, and is currently fighting for his life.  We are hoping he can survive this, but the road to recovery is very long. in the meantime, he has no income coming in and his bills are pilling up as well. Although we are trying our best to help in financially, we are unable to keep up with our own bills as well. We are asking help from friends, family, anyone that has smiled from my dads amazing humor, and to everyone that has grabbed a beer from him to help out if possible. Gary is an amazing father, grandpa, brother, uncle, and friend. He has always been a hard worker, enjoying life even at its ups, and downs. We all hope to see him again as he is an incredible person.  Thank you. ",3698,3000,1 day

https://www.gofundme.com/f/shawns-saviors,Shawns Saviors,"Brittany Waugaman is organizing this fundraiser. My family is currently going through a lot right now my cousin Shawn Bernhardy is fighting for his life in the hospital, it’s been about 6 weeks. He has underwent a few scary procedures one being a craniotomy which unfortunately showed a very serious brain infection cause by being exposed to black mold, it has attacked his basil ganglia, for those who don’t know what that is it refers to a group of subcortical nuclei responsible primarily for motor control, as well as other roles such as motor learning, executive functions and behaviors, and emotions. It’s basically the hard drive to your every move. And to make matters worse the infection has now entered his spine. The name of this life-threatening infection is Mucormycosis, it is a very SERIOUS, but RARE fungal infection. He is currently on a feeding tube, he was on a ventilator but he has been breathing on his own now for about a week, other than at night but I count that as a true MIRACLE! He is fighting and being so strong, we couldn’t be more proud. As you will see in the pictures he is deteriorating quickly, the infection is really acting rather fast. The outcome will eventually take his life but it could be days, weeks, or months there is really nothing anyone can do at this point, it rests in God’s hands!! If anyone would be kind enough and donate some money we all would appreciate it. We need help with his medical expenses, transportation to and from the hospital, and ultimately final expenses. Hospice has talked to the family a few times it’s really just a waiting game but we are trying to do everything we can for Shawn. We are trying to make him as comfortable as possible. So even if you can’t donate anything prayers are much appreciated just please keep my family in your thoughts we really, really, need it in this trying time. Thank you so much and God Bless, hold your loved ones close life is seriously to short! You never know what tomorrow will bring. The pictures below are him before, the picture on the cover was him in the beginning and the bottom picture on this post is him most recent. I know the pictures are tough to see but its the only way to show how serious this is. Again thank you all! ",1567,5000,11-Sep-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/alyshas-road-to-recovery,Alysha’s Road To Recovery," On Monday, October 4th 2021, Alysha unexpectedly experienced her first seizure. About an hour after that, she experienced a second one which left her bottom half in a paralysis. A pattern started occurring and she was having around 1-2 seizures a day, typically when she would wake up in the morning, or when she would lay down for bed each night. This went on for 2 weeks, and after 3 different hospital visits, 2 follow ups with her doctor, CT scans, ultrasounds, x-rays, MRI’S, an EEG test, and finally a spinal tap, Alysha was admitted to Providence on October 17th. The spinal tap told us that Alysha tested positive for cytomegalovirus, a sister strain for Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Since October 4th, Alysha has been completely unable to walk or stand, preventing her from doing anything on her own, including going to the bathroom or taking a shower. She is in a wheelchair and has to have someone with her at all times, day and night. She is on seizure medication now, which means her license is revoked, but she can’t drive anyways due to her paralysis. She is also having a hard time thinking/remembering things, her brain is not functioning 100% from the trauma of how many seizures she has had. This has obviously left her unable to work and we are reaching out for help, as we don’t know how long she is going to be in the hospital for or how long she is going to be unable to move. This will be going to hospital bills, medical equipment she is going to need when discharged, and regular monthly bills that she has. Alysha is in good spirits and trying hard to maintain a positive attitude while she is alone in the hospital. She really appreciates all the prayers, love, and words of encouragement she has received. Thank you to everyone who has reached out and thank you for taking the time to read this.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-adame-family,Help the Adame family," On October 22, 2021, our dad suffered a stroke. The stroke has affected his right side causing him to lose strength to that side of his body. He was progressing until Monday night when we got the news he was bleeding from his brain and needed to be transported to Dallas Methodist for an emergency surgery. He had the emergency surgery necessary to stop the bleeding and relieve pressure from his brain. 12 hours later we were told he would need a second surgery due to another bleed that began in his brain. Doctors have him sedated and asleep so that he may rest and heal. Our dad has now been progressing and is recuperating but doctors have informed us that he has a long road ahead including many physical therapy sessions and future doctors visits. We are hoping and praying he continues to heal and is stable enough by the end of this week so that next week they can wake him up and start the different therapies he will need. This will be very costly on our family. Our dad was our families main source of income. He will no longer be able to work during this time and we do not know what the future holds for his health after his therapies. We pray he can heal completely but this is unknown at this time. We are all trying to be positive. We ask if you can help us with absolutely any donation, we would truly appreciate it. Unfortunately our dad does not have medical insurance. We will use any money raised for medical bills, physical therapy cost, and any other bills our family will face during this difficult time. Whatever the amount anyone is able to donate will be a blessing. Even if you are unable to donate we ask that you please share and say a prayer for our dad.

Tuvo la cirugía de emergencia necesaria para detener el sangrado y aliviar la presión de su cerebro. 12 horas después, nos dijeron que necesitaría una segunda cirugía debido a otra hemorragia que comenzó en su cerebro. Los médicos lo tendrán sedado para que pueda descansar y curarse. Nuestro padre ahora ha progresado y se está recuperando, pero los médicos nos han informado que tiene un largo camino para recuperación , incluidas muchas sesiones de fisioterapia y futuras visitas al médico. Esperamos y rezamos para que continúe sanando y esté lo suficientemente estable al final de esta semana para que la próxima semana puedan despertarlo y comenzar las diferentes terapias que necesitará. Esto será muy costoso para nuestra familia. Nuestro padre era la principal fuente de ingresos de nuestra familia. Ya no podrá trabajar durante este tiempo y no sabemos qué nos espera el futuro para su salud después de sus terapias. Oramos para que pueda sanar completamente, pero esto se desconoce en este momento. Todos intentamos ser positivos. Te preguntamos si puedes ayudarnos con absolutamente cualquier donación, te lo agradeceríamos de verdad. Desafortunadamente no tiene aseguransa médica. Usaremos el dinero recaudado para facturas médicas, costos de fisioterapia y cualquier otra factura que nuestra familia enfrentará durante este momento difícil. Cualquiera que sea la cantidad que alguien pueda donar será una bendición.

At age 2 Maleah had got really sick and was sent home with antibiotics after two weeks of not getting better she was hospitalized at Motts U of M hospital, 11/24/18 her family world was shattered after her diagnoses with stage four Neuroblastoma, a rare terminal child hood cancer. Sense then she has went through several rounds of chemotherapy, radiation, Immunotherapy, two stem cell transplants, and a surgery to removed 2cm tumor near her adraenal. She has been considered no evidence of disease twice after two relapses, but a lot of you may not know Neuroblastoma is a very aggressive cancer that is none for relapse. Maleah had recently started trial in New York receiving a Neuroblastoma vaccine. After her third round she returned home and later started complaining about her eyebrow hurting. After contacting her team of doctors they insured Maleah mother that it was just a side affect from the vaccine. The next morning Maleah woke up paralyzed on her left side of her face. Maleah mother rushed her to the hospital where she received a MRI that confirmed she had a massive tumor in her brain taking up the majority of her left side. Princess Maleah has been considered hospice but we know our little warrior has beat all odds in the past so we are never going to give up hope but most of all FAITH. 8/16/21 she will be having a very risky procedure done to remove the tumor with the hope to give her more quality of life even if its for month or a year. I ask for any donations to help keep Maleah and the family comfortable and to save for any future treatment options or tragedies. Maleah was never eligible for life insurance due to having a terminal cancer so this is where we need our community to come together and bring ease to the family during these hard times. Maleahs mother is not able to work because she is her care giver and her father is the only income. Maleah is the youngest out of six sibling. So please any small donations, a share but most importantly a prayer is needed. Thank you so much! MALEAHSTRONG CHILDHOODCANCERAWARENESS ",5848,25000,13-Aug-21

We worked together at the Kingston Hospital and she has been my mammography technologist for a better part of that time. Mary and a group of ladies that worked together at the hospital (The Sisterhood... as we jokingly refer to ourselves) have remained friends although most of us have moved on to new jobs - always there - always supporting each other in good and bad times. Mary is now at River Radiology, so many of you will know her from being one of her patients ... many will know her as a wonderful co-worker and friend. On behalf of of the Sisterhood (Mary Butta, Lynn Vromann, Cathy Chain, Cindy Bell, Sara Farrell, Louise Vanacore and myself), we would first ask you to pray for our Mary and her family. Mary was admitted to the hospital in mid October suffering from COVID-19. She is still in the ICU and is not responding well to treatments. If you know her - you know that she is worried about her family and loved ones more than herself. She is truly one of the most selfless people I know. Always putting others before herself. Always with a smile, an uplifting story, a hug or a prayer if you needed it! She is a woman of deep faith and shares her love and spirituality with those she knows. It's our time to pay it forward. Last week Mary's father-in-law sadly passed away from COVID-19. We want to help the family with medical and living expenses, as Mary's income was a large part of the family finances. Mary has a wonderful husband Joe, and three boys, Matthew, Adam and Michael. She also is a grandma of four with another on the way. Please donate what you can, every little bit will help. The Sauer Family is facing a huge financial burden, as they are still recovering from a devastating cancer diagnosis of their granddaughter last year. Help us to give this family piece of mind - so that they can concentrate on healing - and not worry about losing their home, paying household expenses or becoming inundated with medical bills.  We are all struggling in this post pandemic time - but we can always find gratitude in our lives and know we ARE truly blessed. Again, please keep Mary and her family in your thoughts and prayers... and do what you can to help. God Bless You. ",7250,100000,7 days

Although Raedon's job will be there for her when she returns, she will not be paid.

In 2006 our world was turned upside down. After battling vision issues for months my husband was diagnosed with MS at the age of 31. I remember sitting and crying together trying to figure out how we were going to explain this to our son, when we had no idea what the future had in store. MS is a progressively debilitating, autoimmune disease that attacks your nervous system, symptoms can range from double vision to full paralysis. We quickly realized that we were in for a lifetime of medication and an uncertain future. After going numb from the neck down his neurologist performed an MRI and concluded that the MS was progressing quickly and aggressively. We had no other choice but to put him on a new drug that had many other side effects, the worst side effect being PML. PML is a virus that could either kill him or severely disable him. He had a better chance of getting PML than getting into a car accident. The treatments and medications Bob has taken are designed to slow the progression of MS. What they don’t do is address things that come with it, like depression, fatigue, and constant pain, which can be an endless loop. He has always hidden his daily struggles from everyone but as time goes on he can no longer hide them. I have started seeing the toll this disease is taking on my sweet husband. The fatigue and pain he fights to be able to support his family is excruciating, the fear of the future in his eyes when he struggles to put words into a sentence. After much research, we have found how HSCT might change his life for the better. HSCT is a treatment mostly used for cancers. However it is being done in other parts of the world for MS and other autoimmune diseases. The objective of the treatment is to stop the progression of the MS and reboot his immune system. This procedure is shown to be around 85% successful. We are hoping that he will no longer have to be on MS treatments or medications afterwards. We are hoping to raise enough money by the end of November to go to Mexico to get this new treatment since it’s not done in the U.S. Now, we have hope; Hope of many years of playing and being active with our grandchildren, lasting health and mobility and hope of freedom from MS. We feel that this is Bob’s best chance at getting his life back. If you want to know more information about MS click here . If you want to learn more about this procedure click here. Follow us on our Facebook page to keep up with his progress as we document his journey. Please share share share!!! We can’t do this without you. Thank you for reading our story and donating!

He had a pure heart and undying strength.  But something that maybe not everyone knew about Shayde was that he suffered from mental illness.  Unfortunately, mental illness is not a battle that one person can face alone, no matter how tough the individual. Within the flurry of events that took place on October 5th, Shayde suffered from a manic attack that left four of our family members in the hospital with injuries that needed emergency medical care.  Fortunately, three of our family members' physical wounds will heal in time but the emotional damage will forever leave a scar in our hearts. “As we wrestled the knife out of Nalu’s hand and repeatedly called out his name, we could see that he was not in there. Even he himself cried out in disbelief ‘Is this real?’. We could all see that this was a body controlled by another person who could never be the Nalu that we loved.” -Knyte Bennett-Jeremiah, brother of Shayde. The Shayde we knew and loved was incapable of those actions. This enemy…mental illness had overtaken him.  Amidst the struggle, Shayde’s heart weakened and on October 11th, just past midnight, filled with hugs and kisses, Shayde peacefully took his last breath in the embrace of his mother and father.We now ask for your help and support to allow the family time for healing.  Life was normal 2 weeks ago but now, it has come to a stand still.  However, the financial burdens are continuing to pile up. Our campaign goal is $50,000. This will be used in the following ways:－ Funeral arrangements and services for Shayde Naluokealoha Bennett-Jeremiah (estimated at $10,000)－ Hospital bills for the Bennett-Jeremiah ohana (estimated at $15,000)－ Ongoing medical bills sustained from the accident (estimated at $15,000)－ Covering additional bills and living expenses to allow the family time to cope and recover from the situation (estimated at $10,000)  Shayde was a beloved son, brother, and role model to many. His contagious laughter will live on forever and the lessons that he shared will continue to bring greatness to the community that he had been an essential part of since he was just a child. Shayde always saw the best in others and strived to bring that out of them, sadly, he struggled to see how amazing he was himself.  And even though Shayde did not have the power to keep fighting, we all will continue the fight for him. Our goal is to raise awareness to those who are suffering with mental illness.  Any additional funds will go towards organizations or events that will help spread awareness for this disease.  We are a strong family and can say how proud we are of the things that Shayde has accomplished. He was the best skateboarding, artist, engineer that the Hawaiian islands have ever seen, but we know that the nightmare of events is reality.  We can't describe in words how much we appreciate the support and love that everyone has shown us in these trying times.  Mahalo nui loa to all who have contributed so far.  You will forever hold a place in our hearts. “Life is a storm, my young friend. You will bask in the sunlight one moment, be shattered on the rocks the next. What makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes. You must look into that storm and shout as you did in Rome. Do your worst, for I will do mine! Then the fates will know you as we know you” ― Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo (Shayde’s favorite movie) Love you always Nalu, From Mom, Dad, Lemalu, and Honi ",16125,50000,17-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-owen-the-caraways,Support Owen & The Caraways!,"Team fundraiserFamily and Friends  of the Caraways and 2 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Alice Caraway. Dearest Friends, Family, and Caring Community,We have created this page in support of Alice and Brian Caraway as their nine-year-old Owen has just been diagnosed with a rare bone cancer—Osteosarcoma—in his right femur. To start, he is going to need three months of chemotherapy followed by reconstructive bone surgery, then five more months of chemotherapy. There are still many unknowns about his condition and treatment plan, and we will be posting updates on their CaringBridge  as we learn more.  The Caraways need you! They need your love, support, help, and company to get through what will be a long journey battling and kicking Osteosarcoma's butt over the next year. As you can imagine, the financial and emotional toll of all of this is and will continue to be overwhelming for the Caraways. Any gift you can give, large or small, will go directly to his treatment and care. Please also post this on your social media and send to those in your life who can offer support.  I know we can all agree on two things: Alice, Brian, and Owen are some of the best people on Earth, and having your child diagnosed with cancer is one of the hardest (perhaps the hardest) experience to go through. We have known Owen since the day he was born. He is family to us and to many. He is sweet, hilarious, insanely smart, multi-talented, loving, and open-hearted. Watching him grow up has been a pleasure and an honor for us all.  Signed with Love & Care Friends & Family of The Caraways A MESSAGE FROM THE CARAWAYS We have been hit with the most devastating news a parent could receive. Our beautiful son, Owen, has been diagnosed with a rare bone cancer called Osteosarcoma. He complained of knee pain which we brushed off as growing pains. This was happening on and off for a few months until one day, it was so excruciating for him that he started crying. He went in for x-rays, then an MRI, then a biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis. It has taken over 3/4ths of his right femur, and hopefully it hasn't metastasized into his lungs. The Orthopedic Oncologist doesn't know if he can keep his femur. The options are Limb Salvage Surgery or Rotationplasty, which both require a prosthetic leg. Owen will have to miss school this year and possibly beyond due to his treatment plan of 2.5 months of chemo, then surgery, and then he will undergo more chemo. If they find it in his lungs, he'll need additional surgery. Typically, if it spreads to the lungs, it will keep coming back. We are completely in shock and absolutely heartbroken. Owen is an absolute gem of a kid. He loves cats, baseball, and he finally learned how to drop into a 4 ft ramp with his skateboard. He recently told us he wants to be an Olympic Skateboarder. He recently told us, ""If I don't win an Olympic Medal for skateboarding, will you still be proud of me?"" He is hilarious, loves to read graphic novels, playing Zelda, and comic books like ""Garfield"".UPDATES & QUESTIONS!  Please do reach out to the Caraways with notes of your love and support! They need it! If you have any questions about his progress, condition, etc., we will post updates here and you can follow his CaringBridge.

As some of you may know, in July of this year Jason was diagnosed with a Brain Tumor. Since then, he has undergone surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and has just completed a 6 week round of Chemo & Radiation at Duke in North Carolina. Jason recently received some very positive news from his Doctors at Duke - Due to carrying certain genetic mutations he is eligible for a life saving treatment in Germany that has yielded extremely positive results in treating this type of tumor. This treatment is not covered by insurance and would involve traveling to and from Germany twelve times over the course of the next year. Needless to say, between treatment, travel & lodging, Jason & his family will incur extremely significant expenses. Many of you have reached out over the past months asking what you can do to help - It is for this reason we are creating this drive. All funds will go directly to Jason to help with his medical care.

Hola, Mi nombré es Stephanie Bannenberg y a mi corta edad de 31 años, me convertí en una estadística de la que jamás pensé ser parte. Me diagnosticaron con cáncer de mama (Carcinoma metastásico ganglionar primario de mama oculto HER 2/neu positivo), en etapa tres y aquí estoy encarando mi diagnóstico de la mejor manera posible. Debido a lo difícil que es recibir atención en hospitales públicos, por la gran cantidad de pacientes oncológicos, se decidió iniciar el tratamiento lo antes posible en una clínica privada siendo la decisión más adecuada y rápida para lo avanzado del cáncer. No obstante, los costos de todo el proceso son extremadamente altos y lamentablemente hemos logrado cubrir muy poco. Sin embargo el panorama es súper favorecedor, los médicos están realmente contentos con el progreso que se ha logrado con tan solo 2 de los 6 ciclos de quimioterapia que llevo, y si todo continúa tan bien como está ahora, en Diciembre estaremos entrando a cirugía con mucha fe y esperanza de la mano de los doctores y la medicina moderna. Mi cirujano oncólogo me ha recomendado la mastectomía preservadora de piel izquierda y disección radical axilar + reconstrucción con colgajo miocutáneo dorsal y prótesis, ya que es fundamental para la extracción de todo el carcinoma y las posibles áreas afectadas. Después de mi reposo post operatorio, debo de pasar por un ciclo de radioterapias y eliminar cualquier rastro del carcinoma. Finalmente y por último tengo que pasar por 18 ciclos de INMUNO terapia anti HER2. Para lograr cubrir los costos y salir victoriosa en la lucha de todo este duro proceso, es necesario recaudar la cantidad de $40.000 USD, los cuales se destinarán al pago de: Quimioterapias, Cirugía, Radioterapia, Inmunoterapia y demás exámenes necesarios para el control del progreso. Sé que es una cantidad muy alta para algunos, pero con cualquier cantidad de dinero que esté a tu alcance, me estarías ayudando a poner fin a este episodio difícil de mi vida. La vida te recompensará con muchas cosas hermosas como la salud y el amor. Gracias y prometo no rendirme. Gracias y prometo no rendirme! _____________________________________ Hello, my name is Stephanie Bannenberg and at the young age of 31, I became a statistic that I never thought I was a part of. I was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer (HER 2 / neu positive occult primary nodal metastatic breast cancer) and here I am approaching my diagnosis in the best possible way. Due to how difficult it is to receive care in public hospitals and because of a large number of cancer patients, it was decided to start as soon as possible in a private clinic, being the most appropriate and quick decision for the advanced stage of cancer. However, the costs of the entire process are extremely high and unfortunately, we have managed to cover very little. However, the outlook is super flattering. The doctors are really happy with the progress that has been made with only 2 of the 6 cycles of chemotherapy, and if everything continues as well as it is now, in December we will be entering surgery with a lot of faith and hope from the hand of doctors and modern medicine. My oncologist surgeon has recommended a left skin-sparing mastectomy and axillary radical dissection + reconstruction with a dorsi myocutaneous flap and prosthesis since it is essential for the extraction of all the carcinoma and possible affected areas. After my post-operative rest, I must go through a cycle of radiotherapy and remove any trace of the carcinoma. In order to do this, I have to go through 18 cycles of IMMUNE anti-HER2 therapy. To be able to cover the costs and be victorious in the fight of all this hard process, it is necessary to raise the amount of $ 40,000 USD, which will be used to pay for: Chemotherapies, Surgery, Radiotherapy, Immunotherapy and other necessary tests. I know that is a very high amount of money, but you would be helping me end this difficult episode in my life with whatever contribution you can. Life will reward you with many beautiful things like health and love. Thank you! and I promise not to give up. ",13269,40000,14-Oct-21

At the end of September, Kimmy had a terrible fall in which she hit her head and severely injured her ankle. She was rushed to the hospital where a CT scan showed a large mass in her brain and was immediately seen by a neuro oncologist at MGH. Kim was scheduled for surgery to remove the mass immediately. In addition to the brain surgery, she also found out that she ruptured her Achilles tendon which required surgery to repair the damage. Kim will be in a cast for 3 months unable to walk or drive. Her cancer treatment begins in 4 weeks. She will require 6 weeks of daily radiation followed by 3 rounds of chemotherapy. She will be unable to work for an undetermined amount of time.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ub3rs-help-for-mei-mei,Help for Mei Mei," Hello, my name is Chris Best. My wife and I own The Rust Belt Market in Ferndale Michigan.  This little market is specifically for makers, collectors and artists to have a safe harbor in which to have a small store. We are something of a collective of creative, hard working entrepreneurs.  One of our long time vendors has suffered a stroke. Mei Mei Zhao has been a vendor with us for 10 years and she was recently forced to discontinue her stay here. She cannot make her soap products she sells as she has lost the use of her left hand. She is also unable to walk unassisted.  The acute CVA hemiparesis and ataxia has turned her world upside down. She needs financial assistance. All of us here at The Rust Belt Market are sick about her circumstance.  We are like a family as we’ve known Mei Mei for a decade now.. She is scared. Her family is scared. At 67 she has began physical therapy as she refuses to give up. We all thank you in advance for your generosity. If you would like to keep reading, here is a bit about Mei Mei’s interesting back story:  Mei Mei immigrated to Singapore from Rengan, Malaysia in 1965 when her father saw more opportunity for his family in a more liberalized country. It was in Singapore her sister married a man who owned a soap factory. Mei Mei learned from her sister the ingredients and craft of soap making using coconuts from Malaysia to make oil as an essential ingredient. It was also in Singapore where Mei Mei would meet her husband, a man from Alma, Michigan. Her late husband, Jim, was a deep sea diver employed by an offshore oil company to explore new territory to drill. Jim ultimately retired back to Michigan with Mei Mei where she came face to face with a new culture and a new climate. The cold, dry winters left her skin dry and in need of repair. She began making soap again with coconut oil. It worked better than the soaps found in the average supermarket for her. An enterprising Mei Mei began selling  her wonderful products at local farmers markets to a clientele in need of better soap. Over 20 years, she built a loyal and grateful following and thus, a prosperous business for herself. That is, until the recent, crippling stroke.  We thank you for taking the time to read through all of this. Again, thank you for your consideration! ",9672,10000,5 days

Right now, while we just wait for few-and-far-between updates from overwhelmed medical staff trying to get to every family, there's not much we *can* do. Perhaps the only thing we can do is send prayers, help keep Courtney's phone free as she waits anxiously for updates, and ease their financial burden of medical bills and general expenses while EZ is out of work.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-mindy-harris-heal,Help Mindy Harris Heal," Mindy Harris is the kind of mother everyone wishes they had and the kind of friend who is utterly mortified to be the center of attention or to ask for anything from anyone. Because she is a GIVER. But life has thrown her so many curveballs that it’s a miracle she is still alive to raise her five incredible children, ages 1-15. She was hit with Crohn’s Disease, Thyroid Cancer and Lyme Disease as a young adult  and has been battling them for the past 25 years. Doctors, medicines, infusions, injections, food restricted diets, more doctors, many surgeries, plus alternative doctors, supplements and treatments have kept her alive, but barely. Then she was in a head-on car collision that she miraculously survived but she has not been the same since. She can’t digest food, can barely walk and her surgical wounds from her colostomy won’t heal. She has been on very restricted diets for years because she has so many intolerances and suffers from malnourishment severe enough that twice this month, she crawled upstairs with her baby to put him down from a nap then laid down herself but woke up without the energy she needed to even be able to raise her eyelids. Her mouth could barely say a word or two with great effort and she couldn’t open her eyes or wiggle anything no matter how hard she tried. It was terrifying for her and her family.  BUT THERE IS HUGE HOPE!! Some of her friends pooled their money and paid for a small amount of stem cell therapy which cost $4200 and she instantly started feeling wonderful healing changes occurring! She noticed within 24 hours that she had more energy, less pain, and her wound started healing instead of getting worse like had been for months. Over the next week, she started being able to walk and carry her baby again! Her eight year old son remarked, “You’re not using your I’m dying voice anymore!”It was the miracle she had been praying for for many, many years! She texted the following to a friend who gifted the whole family with a first-ever theme park trip. She had to ride in a wheelchair but this day would have been unimaginable two weeks ago:  “Spending the day with you and my kids was a highlight for the memory books! Oh my goodness! It felt SO good to be living my life again instead of waiting, waiting, waiting for my health to be better, for my body to get strong enough to walk again, for enough money, health and energy to do the things I want to do! It was just sooo NICE and soooo FUN!!!! I drove home lighter than a feather even though I should have been exhausted. It just felt sooooo GOOD to do something, anything, fun with the people I love most! I feel a renewed sense of hope and victory!!! I’m sooooo grateful that after all these years and all the things I’ve tried, I finally have a direction. I finally know of something that can help! The only way I can describe the new sense of vitality I have now is to say that it feels like I’ve grabbed hold of the Savior’s robe. I’ve been bleeding internally without hope of medicinal rescue for ten weeks. But, oh! The feeling I feel now! I can FEEL my body healing for the first time in over a decade! It feels like I’m being given my life back!!!!”  A full treatment costs $17.5k (2 treatments are recommended) and we are trying to raise that money plus enough to see an integrative MD so our total goal is $40K.  Her equally hardworking, supportive, and loving husband has his own hurdles since he fractured his skull six years ago. With a serious traumatic brain injury that he is still working to recover from, it is challenging for him to work. He does it anyway whether he feels well or not, but the money to pay for true healing for Mindy is just not there and now is when she needs it. Mindy and her family are the most fun and light-filled people you will ever meet! She has wonderful children who are so kind and loving to everyone.  She is irreplaceable as a mom and a friend, and we, her friends, are overjoyed to have found a treatment for her that actually WORKS! We would be so grateful for any help you can give.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/kadens-cranial-helmet,Kaden’s cranial helmet," Hello everyone, I am trying to raise funds to help my brother and his wife pay for their 5 month old son Kaden’s cranial helmet for torticollis and plagiocephaly. If you can please take a moment to read his story below. We noticed that Kaden was having a difficult time being able to turn his head to one side but his doctor was not concerned at first. We went to his 5 month appointment and that is when things changed. We were referred to the Hanger Clinic for a helmet as well as an X Ray to determine if the bone on his forehead had be fused early. ( thankfully it was not) The Hanger Clinic is where it was determined that he had torticollis (The cause is likely from the baby's position in the uterus which leads to injury to the neck muscles.) as well as due to his neck muscles being weaker plagiocephaly (Deformational, or positional, plagiocephaly is when a baby develops a flat spot on one side of the head or the whole back of the head. It happens when a baby sleeps in the same position most of the time or because of problems with the neck muscles that result in a head-turning preference.) The back of his head is flat on one side causing one side of his head to be pushed out which is causing the bone on his forehead to be more noticeable. Once he gets his helmet he will need to wear it for 23 hours a day for several months. Kaden is also already starting to show signs of facial and ear shifts which can cause problems later on. If he doesn’t receive the helmet ASAP he can have greater misaligned facial features as well as other issues with eating, speaking as well as possible brain development. We are currently waiting on a referral to start PT for his neck muscles but because his plagiocephaly is considered severe we will be moving forward to getting the helmet right away. Sadly Tricare ( our medical insurance company) does not see the necessity of covering medical devices or any of the appointments that go along with. We have looked into a grant that could possibly help but unfortunately we do not qualify. Thank you for reading and know that any donation no matter how small can help them to get a helmet on Kaden.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/s7hrm3-help-courtney,Help Courtney," For those of you that don't know, my dear friend Courtney Nelson, has been in the hospital since October 5th and is in the ICU right now. What started as an ear infection, turned out to be Covid pneumonia in both lungs. She then got a clot in her right lung and had to go in to surgery to remove it and then ended up with a bacteria infection on top of everything. She's now in a medically induced coma. She really really needs prayers and positive thoughts right now... I decided to start this ""go fund me"" because I'm not sure if all her medical expenses will be covered or not by her insurance and on top of that, she's  a single mother who's been out of work for almost a month already. Any little bit will be greatly appreciated, whether it's donating what you can or simply praying for her.  ",2615,10000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/fighting-nec-with-benjamin,Fighting NEC with Benjamin," It's suppose to be a happy and celebratory time when a baby is born, but little Benji was born at just 26 weeks. The doctors didn't seem too worried but I could tell there was always a chance he might not make it. BUT HE DID! He was taken from me as soon he was born, I never even got to hold my boy. After an emergency surgery and coming out of sedation, I was allowed to see my new baby in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, NICU. Seeing your baby hooked up to tubes and being so little and fragile hurt me. We cried but he was doing it! We were discharged fairly early and I was allowed to come home to the rest of my family and a toddler whom I hadn't seen in a week! 2 days later I had an emergency call. Benjamin had to be life flighted from Woodlands Memorial to the Children's Hospital Downtown. We live in Magnolia so time was not on our side. We rushed to consent and my baby was life flighted downtown. He had developed NEC. Necrotizing Enterocolitis, I had to look it up. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal problem that mostly affects premature babies. The condition inflames intestinal tissue, causing it to die. A hole (perforation) may form in your baby's intestine. Bacteria can leak into the abdomen (belly) or bloodstream through the hole. NEC usually develops within two to six weeks after birth. In some infants, NEC is mild. Others experience severe, life-threatening symptoms. When we arrived downtown for Emergency surgery, we were told that Benjamin's case was life threatening and that over 50% of his intestines were removed as well as 50% of his colon. We were completely devastated!!! The next few days and weeks were horrible, a complete nightmares! He needed multiple surgeries and more intestine had to be removed. My poor baby was constantly under anesthesia. His chances for survival were critical and even now after 4 surgeries back to back he will need another life altering surgery soon. Because of where we live and this dire situation I have been forced to close my small studio which was the source of my income, my Husband has missed and will continue to miss days of work, childcare has been hard to find and the chances my baby still might not make it all weigh over us like a dark blanket. It has affected our income significantly just to be by Our little fighters side. Every day is a fight and everyday we pray he grows stronger so that his fighting chances are high. Between medical expenses, loss of work and distance,  our Family needs help. Please join us in praying for Benjamin Bear Salcido and hoping his fight isn't for nothing and that he may be able to live a fulfilling life. I wanna thank all our family and friends that have been supportive and giving us the strength to continue and the push to start this page. Thank you and God bless. ",2870,10000,6 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-chelsea-pay-for-medical-expenses,Help Chelsea Pay for Medical Expenses,"Team fundraiserChelsea Coye and 3 others are organizing this fundraiser. Hi friends! To be honest I've been avoiding a GoFundMe as long as I could. I thought I could get through this recurrence of cancer without asking for help. But as time goes on and I've added many treatments to my healing and the costs are adding up. Between surgeries, copays, drugs, treatments and supplements I just can't keep up anymore. I know times are tough for a lot of people with Covid still making an impact on the world around us. But even if you can only give the cost of a coffee or a dinner I promise it will be put to good use in my healing.If you didn't know I was originally diagnosed with stage 3c low grade ovarian cancer back in 2011. I did surgery and intense chemotherapy back then and then for the next almost 10 years I was blessed with no evidence of disease and was able to build this beautiful life in Colorado with my husband, Matt. Last year just before Thanksgiving I found out that my cancer had returned. I had surgery in March to remove the tumor but unfortunately when I had a follow up scan in July it had already returned again.  Right now I have a good plan combining both conventional and integrative treatments for my rare, hard to treat cancer. There is no solid path for someone with low grade ovarian cancer who also has no gene mutations. Low grade cancer doesn't respond well to chemotherapy and most of the drugs approved to treat ovarian cancer are targeted to gene mutations. But we are trying many things in hopes that something sticks. Some of these things are covered by insurance but others are not.In order to give myself the very best chance of beating this thing I am driving to Boulder twice a week (3 hours round trip) for infusions, taking several different drugs and supplements and giving myself weekly injections. The cost is adding up quickly.  I truly appreciate any support you can provide and even if it's not money - I would love to just hear from you through a Facebook or text message to reconnect and hear how you're doing to distract me from my world of cancer. Or if you're local and want to get together for a coffee date I would so love that too! I will be back in Maine this year for Thanksgiving and Christmas and would love to see any of my east coast friends around that time.  Much love to you all and thank you so much!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/hc8fur-amandas-fight-against-breast-cancer,Amanda's Fight Against Breast Cancer,"Elyce Hall is organizing this fundraiser. Hello Everyone,  We are Elyce and Ashley, fundrasing for our close friend Amanda. There is never a good time to receive a life-altering medical diagnosis, and there is no amount of preparation that can ease the blow when the unexpected does arise. Amanda can attest to this harsh reality all too well.  Recently, a routine health check identified a mass in her breast which promoted further tests and scans.  While Amanda prayed for the best, ultimately, she was greeted with a diagnose that would turn her world upside down.  The diagnosis was triple-negative breast cancer.  This aggressive form of cancer prompted an equally aggressive treatment plan that has forced Amanda out of work for an unforeseeable amount of time.  The decision did not come easily for this 32-year-old single mother, but ultimately, she had to put her health first as she geared herself up for the long battle ahead.   For those of you who know Amanda, you know her as a hard worker, a great mother, but most importantly, you know her as a fighter.  Throughout these unfathomable times, she has tried her hardest to stay positive for her daughter’s sake; yet the uncertainty of her current situation has understandably created a great deal of stress.  This unexpected diagnosis has created a financial burden that no amount of saving could have prepared her for and with no income coming in, Amanda has been forced to drain the savings she has worked so hard to build. Again, if you are someone who knows Amanda, you know that asking for help in any way is extremely difficult for her to do.  She is fiercely independent and yet, even the strongest among us need help at times. With that being said, right now more than ever, she needs the help of her friends, family, and any of those amongst us who are willing to lend a helping hand in this time of uncertainty.   We understand that times are hard for so many right now, but with the holidays fast approaching we hope that people will take this cause into consideration. For those who can give, your donation would be greatly appreciated.  For those who cannot give, we just ask that you help spread the word.  Every little bit helps right now, and we are grateful for anyone who can assist with our goal.   While Amanda’s diagnosis is enough to keep her occupied, she is also being forced to leave her home for 9 years.  Please, if you hear of anything in the 2-3 bedroom range reach out to me or Amanda.  Amanda is loved by many and we ask that you all send positive vibes her way for a long battle ahead.  ",5225,5000,19-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/lisa-joann-little-lvad-heart-transplant-fund,Lisa (Little) Cope - LVAD & Heart Transplant Fund," I am creating this GoFundMe page for our Mother Lisa (Little) Cope. She was diagnosed with Cardiomyopathy over a decade ago and recently took a turn for the worse. She has had a defibrillator for nearly 10 years and was being monitored by her physicians. In the last few months she was referred to Kaiser Santa Clara’s Advanced heart failure team. On October 22nd, she went to Santa Clara for a routine procedure to check up on her heart function. They discovered she was approaching liver failure due to her heart being unable to function, they also discovered that her heart has weakened to the point the doctors think it’s a miracle she was able to walk in that day. At this point, they hospitalized her in the CICU and do not want her to return home until she receives a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) as a Bridge to a heart transplant. She is doing well and in high spirits in the CICU, but she would not be able to function in day-to-day life without an LVAD. An LVAD is a mechanical device that replaces the function of a failing heart, and acts as a life-sustaining device while patients await a hear transplant. As of this writing, the LVAD surgery is scheduled for Tuesday, November 2nd 2021. Lisa lost her mother at the age of 5 to heart disease. She almost lost her sister Janice to heart disease over a decade ago. The LVAD and subsequent heart transplant saved Janice’s life. This is now the journey that Lisa is on to save her life. She needs an LVAD and will soon after need a heart transplant. Lisa and Janice have a rare genetic disease that causes heart failure, PLN Cardiomyopathy, which is caused by a genetic mutation in the DNA. This disease often leads to severe heart failure and also sudden premature death. This is an inherited disease. Lisa and her physicians have done everything possible to maintain her health, but her genes are in control. Now is the time to undergo extensive surgery, which requires a minimum of 6-8 weeks of recovery in Santa Clara, CA. Then further recovery at home in Penryn, CA. This is just the beginning of a long road ahead for Lisa and her family. Lisa will need assistance with the costs of maintaining her home in Penryn, CA and maintaining her temporary home in Santa Clara, CA simultaneously along with medical expenses, transportation costs for her and her children, food, etc. Lisa’s recovery requires a hands-on caregiver to be with her, which can be one of her children, sister, significant other, etc. This is a very hands-on time intensive situation that will place a financial burden on those assisting in her care, not to mention the psychosocial burden as well. Lisa and her family would greatly appreciate your prayers during this time. Prayer for a successful surgery, fast and complete recovery, and for strength for Lisa and her children. The family would also appreciate monetary donations or gift cards to gas stations, grocery stores, etc. Every dollar counts and will be used toward the care of Lisa and supporting her to return to a normal life with the assistance of an LVAD. Even $5 would cover a gallon of gas for her caregivers, or appointments in Santa Clara. We would be very grateful if you could share this page with her friends and family. We know she has touched many lives over the years (animal and human) and we hope that her many friends can help her during this difficult time, whether that is with phone calls, visits, donations, and most importantly, prayer. We will use this page as a central place to update everyone on Lisa’s progress. Thank you ",5050,20000,2 days

Owens Stem Cell Transplant Fundraiser Join us in sending Owen to Florida for a Stem Cell Transplant. Owen and his family have been struggling with this unfortunate accident. While we are currently taking Owen to physical therapy sessions, neurologist visits and a psychiatrist comes to him, Owen isn’t seeing progress at this time. We need your help with a Stem Cell Transplant. Your donation will make a huge impact on Owens successful treatment. Timing is very important for Stem Cell treatment in Spinal Cord injuries. Owen is 6 months post injury, we need the Transplant as soon as possible. Studies have shown that Stem Cell Transplant recipients have the highest success rate if they are less than 1 year from the accident date. Your donation will directly affect Owens greatest chance to recover from this catastrophic injury by having a Stem Cell Therapy.  Owen will go to St Petersburg Florida for the Transplant. He has been approved for the procedure, we now need donations for Owen and his family to make this happen.  This is a letter from Owen’s Mom (Jolene): My name is Jolene Hansen. I am married to Jesse Hansen, we have four kids Macy who is 20, Owen is 17, Cael is 14 and Luke is 7. We have always lived in Council Bluffs. Right now we rent a house at 229 12th Ave. On February 11th, 2021 my 16 year old son, Owen, was snowboarding on a hill by Abraham Lincoln high school alone. He was building his own jumps and practicing his snowboarding. He had my car and was supposed to pick me up from work so he was on his last jump for the day. He was doing a 360 and he overturned and landed on his forehead and crashed to his back. He instantly broke his neck. He snapped his C4 and his C5 shattered and left a cut in his spinal cord.             At first he panicked, he couldn’t move his arms or legs and when he tried to yell for help he couldn’t get his words out. The paralysis made it so that he could not get his words out they were too soft. So he calmed himself down and turned to God. He started praying and instantly felt a calmness come over him. He prayed that God would send someone to find him. Because of where he was at on the hill it was hard to make out that it was a person laying there. He laid there for around 30 minutes praying. 5 minutes after he asked God that someone would see him he heard a faint voice. At first he thought he was imagining it but then a few minutes later he heard footsteps. It was his angel Missy Murphy.             Missy and her daughter were on their way home from an appointment. Something made her take the scenic way home that day. And as they drove by the hill Owen was on she saw something laying there. She wasn’t sure if someone had just left their things there or what but she felt the need to stop and check because it was so cold that day.  She turned around and parked her car and walked the few blocks through the snow and as she got closer she could see it was a person. She said that she finally seen the flicker of Owens beautiful eyelashes. Thank goodness Owen was still conscience. He was able to tell her his name and my phone number. After she called the ambulance she called me at work and sat and prayed with him until the medics and I arrived. I got there right after the ambulance. Missy told me that she had been praying with him and that he could not feel his legs. I really didn’t comprehend what was going on right away. Then the first responders said that they were taking him to the trauma center at UMNC. That is when I kind of realized what was going on and that it was serious. I saw Owen as they put him into the ambulance and he said I’m ok mom I love you! Owen had surgery to try and repair his injuries but the doctors told us that they were not sure if he was going to ever be able to walk or use his arms again.  Please…..if you have the ability to donate for Owens chance to heal and possibly move again, we will forever be grateful to all.  Thank you for your consideration.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/relief-for-taryn,Relief for Taryn," This fundraiser was created in support of my dear friend, Taryn Marquez. Taryn (or as I fondly refer to her , ""T"") is currently at Tampa General Hospital recovering from COVID. T has been in the hospital since mid-August when she was admitted for worsening symptoms. She spent almost a month intubated on a ventilator in a medically induced coma and nearly lost her life. It's a miracle that Taryn survived as all health professionals caring for her expected otherwise. Taryn is now off the ventilator and breathing well with only supplemental oxygen. She’s lucid and has recovered her voice, use of her arms and hands, but she has yet to regain the ability to walk or stand on her own. Taryn is undergoing intense physical therapy, but COVID has ravaged her body and one of the effects was severe nerve damage. As a result of this nerve damage she’s experiencing excruciating neuropathic pain in her legs and feet which is drastically slowing down the rehab process. Devestatingly, Taryn’s insurance lapsed before her hospitalization and she will be left with extensive medical debt. There’s no telling when T will be able to return to work as she has a very long road ahead to a full recovery. I often refer to T as my real life guardian angel. She's the kindest, most hard-working, beautiful human I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. She is someone who never asks for help but is always willing to go out of her way for others, I am asking for help for my dear friend now. If you'd like to read more about Taryn’s journey, you can find further details provided by her sister below. Thank you in advance for your help. If you would, please join me in keeping Taryn in your thoughts and prayers. With Gratitude, Hafsa Lewis----------------------------------------Taryn became ill with bronchitis around August 5th. On August 12th she went to the ER as her symptoms continued getting worse. She was immediately admitted to the hospital because they found she had developed pneumonia. She was given a Covid test with negative results, spent 4 days at the hospital, and discharged to recover at home. On August 18th, Taryn collapsed at home and had to be rushed to Tampa General by ambulance. She was immediately admitted as the pneumonia had become severe and soon after she tested positive for Covid. Within 36 hours of being admitted to the hospital, Taryn had to be intubated and put on a ventilator. On September 1st, after 2 weeks on the ventilator, doctors informed the family that since there had been zero improvement in Taryn’s condition, as well as her being severely immunocompromised due to numerous pre-existing conditions, her case was the worst imaginable. They said her prognosis was dire and advised the family to prepare themselves because she likely wouldn’t make it and suggested Hospice.By the grace of God, the very next day, Taryn began to improve. The level of oxygen and amount of assistance to her lungs provided by the ventilator was incrementally reduced, they extubated her and performed a tracheostomy so they could continue using the ventilator while minimizing further damage to her vocal cords, and they began bringing her out of sedation. After an additional two weeks on the ventilator, and what seemed like an eternity waiting for her to wake up, on September 15th Taryn finally awoke and was shortly thereafter weaned off the ventilator. There was concern about brain damage or a stroke as she was exhibiting worrisome signs of such, but she became fully lucid within a week or so and transferred out of ICU into the step-down Pulmonary Care Unit.Since then, Taryn’s progress has been nothing short of a miracle. She’s made such rapid improvements that she was able to be moved to a non-critical floor. The trache has been removed and she’s regained her voice. She’s eating on her own and soon the G-tube that’s been being used to provide nutrition will be removed. She has use of her hands and arms, albeit it shakily. but she still can’t can’t stand or walk on her own. Taryn is receiving intensive physical therapy daily, but her rehab process will be long, particularly because she has Chronic Illness Neuropathy and the severe nerve pain in her feet and legs is impeding her progress with PT. The pain is being treated with a cocktail of medications but nothing fully relieves it.Thankfully, her lungs have healed almost fully and she’s no longer expected to have breathing problems in the future as they initially believed. There are still issues with her blood pressure as it tends to get critically low, or spike dangerously high, as well as her blood sugar and heart rate. But the doctors believe this is all due to the damage caused by Covid and eventually her body will again be able to self-regulate. This all being said, Taryn is a fighter and is determined to walk again and fully recover as soon as possible. She powers through the pain during each physical therapy session in order to get as much benefit as possible out of it and is getting stronger every day. Most importantly, Taryn is fully aware of the miracle of her journey and is eternal grateful for surviving and being given another chance at life. -Cindy Marquez ",7055,100000,5 days

Ava loves princesses so it is only fitting that we begin her story with Once upon a time... A beautiful, sassy, little girl named Ava was living her very best 4-year-old princess life in Richmond, Virginia. Her mother and father battled many miscarriages and fought to bring Ava into the world. Ava is their miracle and until Sunday, September 5th she was the epitome of your typical healthy 4-year-old. What we didn't know, was that lurking deep in the back of Ava's brain was an evil tumor. Over the last month Ava had been waking up with a headache and upset tummy. After an hour or so she would feel fine and go about her day doing what princesses do, like riding her bike, going to the pool, or looking for the neighborhood cat.  Kassi, Ava's mother, was worried about her. After speaking with the doctor, she just couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong, so she took her to the Children's Hospital. Once at the hospital, Ava was taken for a CT scan where they confirmed there was a tumor. The evil tumor is in the cerebellum and pressing on the spinal cord at the base of the brain causing the headaches and nausea in the morning. Ava was admitted to the hospital and placed in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. On Monday, September 6th, Ava was taken for an MRI. The MRI confirmed everyone's fears, the evil tumor was thought to be a Medulloblastoma and most likely malignant. The Neurosurgical team determined the evil tumor needed to come out as soon as possible and the 5-hour surgery is scheduled for Wednesday, September 8th. We are hopeful the team will be able to remove the entire tumor and for the best possible outcome from the surgery and pathology.  Kassi and Brian are right by Ava's side. Their family not only has a long road ahead of them with Ava's treatment and medical bills, they are victims of the employment crisis caused by Covid-19. Please help us take some of the burden off them so they can focus on getting our spunky, sassy, little princess back to ruling the land and her happily ever after. #prayforAva Thank you for your positive healing thoughts and prayers!

I am currently a senior at UC Davis studying Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior. Since I was 14 years old, I have been dealing with knee issues that occurred from a traumatic event. The past seven years have been greatly detrimental on my health and my family's financial state as an aftermath of this traumatic event.  At 17 years old, I got diagnosed with a torn meniscus and got my first surgery. At 18 years old, I got a second knee surgery because my first surgeon messed up, causing my knee to get worse. Now at 21 years old, my meniscus is torn again for unknown reasons, but the only way to fix it is to get a 3rd surgery. For the last year, I have been constant pain and have to wear a knee brace at all times to the point that a third surgery is my only option to try and fix my meniscus again. Due to all of this, my family cannot afford to cover my surgery cost and I have to pay for it myself. The surgeries, physical therapy, and doctor's appointments I have had to deal with for 7 year has been very tolling on my family and me.  I am a full-time student, I have a part-time job, and an unpaid research position.  I am a first generation student from a single mother household, so being able to finish my education is very important to me.   I would greatly appreciate any donation that you could make as it will help me to cover the out of pocket expenses for my surgery and post-op recovery. Thank you for listening for my story and your generosity.  ",1425,2000,2 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/michael-needs-your-help-to-save-his-sight,PLEASE Michael needs your help to save his sight.,"Deborah Chansky-Kalisz is organizing this fundraiser. I've pondered on doing this fundraiser but I have no other choice as I'm running out of options as time is running out and the clock is ticking down. I was advised yesterday 9/28 by the authorization/ billing dept at the hospital I/Michael needs to come up with a huge co-insurance. My son Michael needs your help PLEASE.... We have met his deductible but his co-insurance is at $4800  he needs to come up with in just 2 days as on Friday October 1, 2021 he is schduled at Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and with me being on full disability and a tight budget because of my knees, I don't have the funds in this short notice to help him with this scheduled cornea saving surgury. I do have Carecredit which I have the funds available on but unfortunately the hospital, Basom Palmer does not take this type of credit :'(  My heart is breaking ... as I'm having to ask no beg for financial help to help Michael and I'm also asking for much needed prayers as well. I copied and pasted below from my fb post from earlier this week, not knowing when I posted it, Michael would need financial assistance. Please consider making a donation, you can help make this surgery happen and any donation amount will help...no donation is too small and will help him with this overwhelming huge financial burde just put on our shoulders and please know every single dollar will all go directly to his co-insurance. If you want more information please feel free to private message me, I will answer any and all questions and provide any additional information you may want. Thank you in advance for your time in reading my plea to help my son. Much love Debbie & Michael. "" My heart is breaking for my son Michael as he is having to have surgery on his right eye to save his sight from the horrible botched lasik procedure he had done on both his eyes in mid 2019. They did corrective surgery on his left eye this past December 2020 to attempt to save his sight, his cornea from a bulging cornea due to the Dr cutting his flap of his cornea 3 different times in the same procedure because he messed up and did not tell us in 2019. Bascom Palmer surgeon did what they could to stop the cornea from bulging further but only could get Michael sight to 20/70 and they were able to stop the cornea from bulging out further. The surgeon who from Bascom Palmer was concerned about Michael right eye as he had both eyes lasik done the same day in 2019. Michaels right eye has now decreased in vision from 20/15 from December 2020 when we got Bascom Palmer Eye Institute involved to help to now Michael vision is 20/35 and because the P.O.S. Doctor who performed the original lasik in 2019 who cut Michael's flap of his cornea in both his eyes 3 times... his right eye is now degrading and they are trying to stop it from further degrading they are trying to stop the cornea from bulging now in his right eye, they are going to try to save his sight in the right eye. Michael is now schduled and having surgery this Friday as the surgeon said he is going to do his best to save Michael sight in his right eye from progressing and getting much worse, the surgeon is going to do his best so Michael at just 23 will not need a cornea transplant all from a botched lasik job in 2019. ( tge botched lasik was not done at Bascom Palmer it was done by a Dr. in West Palm Beach Fl with Is no affiliation whatsoever with Baskin Palmer) Michael will be in recovery for 3 to 4 weeks depending on how well is right eye heals. He will not be able to work during his recovery. My boy as many of u who know us personally know he is a fighter a true Warrior in all sense of the word. He is only 23 years young and he has already been though a whole lifetime of medical struggles no one should ever endure, from being diagnosed in November 2011 and fighting cancer from that date at the age of 13 years 8 months old through his teenage years and Michaels spirt never broke and beat the several bouts of cancer This time it's not cancer and the realization of loosing his sight due to the botched lasik has him truly frightened like I have never seen him before. Michael said to me moments ago...""mom I'm petrified I'm going to be blind I'm not going to be able to see, I'm not going to be able to drive, i won't be able to work, to physically see you, my dogs, my friends to see what my future before me holds...mom I'm really scared"" all I could do is grab a hold of him tight and tell him we got the best surgeon in the whole United States performing the surgery and its OK to be afraid, it's OK Michael to cry as I held him doing my best to hold back my own tears from him, to be strong for him. Please say a prayer for my son Michael, please keep him in your daily prayers PLEASE! Thank you & much love. P S. I have great comfort in knowing we are very Blessed to have amazing world renown surgeon at the #1 rated Eye Institute in the whole United States at Basom Palmer Eye Institute of Miami, Florida.

He has been a handyman is whole life and uses those skills to make a living. He raised 4 kids using these skills. Mostly living paycheck to paycheck, hustling handyman work. Recently, Billy Joe, fell off a ladder while doing a job for a client and fractured his L1, L2 and L3. The injury is a wedged compression fracture of the L1 that slammed down onto the L2 and collapsing it onto his L3. Unfortunately, Billy Joe will need to have surgery in order to get this properly fixed. The Docs suggest the Kyphoplasty... non-invasive just two incisions they go in and put balloons in and then fill them with a pasty compound called PMMA. Which hardens and creates an internal cast inside of the fractured vertebra. With this comes bills. Due to Billy Joe being injured, he is not able to work as a handyman in order to pay his bills. I am setting up this fundraiser to try and relieve some of the stress of having bills looming over the head of a healing man. In order to properly heal, Billy Joe needs to take the time to rest and properly recover. Any help in relieving financial stresses will help in his recovery. His children are doing everything they can to help out in these trying times, to include setting up this page for him. Billy Joe is a prideful man and finds it extremely difficult to ask anybody for help. Any donations will go directly into helping Billy Joe recover and get back on his feet. This will help with medical bills, and to cover his personal bills during recovery! He is a hard working man that loves his wife, dogs, kids and g-babies. Anything to help get this man back on his feet to live life to the fullest is greatly appreciated! As his son, I would like to personally thank anybody that helps with this cause. I will do anything i can to help him and thank you for helping. He may be to prideful to ask for help, but i am not.

This is exactly what happened to my daughter-in-law. For over a year, she was told that the lump was nothing to be worried about and was treated for orthopedic issues without further testing.  After a year of worsening symptoms, she made the decision to change doctors and ultimately, received her diagnosis.Upon receiving the devastating news in 2020, Keyshia attempted chemotherapy and radiation, however, it was unsuccessful due to the fact that her body was rejecting the chemo because she is unable to produce platelets.Fast forward to 2021 and the doctors told Keyshia and her husband there was nothing else they could do for her. Yet, she is still here fighting!! She is fighting to live for her husband and their 8 children; 4 of which are minors.As you can imagine, this diagnoses has taken a toll on the family in every way possible. Our family has endured unimaginable challenges emotionally, spiritually, psychologically, and financially.

I created this page (without their awareness or approval, I am their youngest sister) with hopes of collecting enough funds to give them peace of mind financially while they focus on care and recovery.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-newly-disabled-trans-person-survive-thrive,Help Newly Disabled Trans Person Survive & Thrive," My name is Mary, and Avery is my sibling. Many of you know Avery from their years in the Minneapolis community, or maybe you met them while hiking the Appalachian Trail. Maybe you met them in Salt Lake City, or they taught you how to kayak on the Mississippi River! Maybe you haven’t met in person, or you met them in their new home in NYC. They are one of the first people I call, and a fabulous queer person that ceases to run out of stories to tell. I know how important mutual aid and community activism has been for Avery, and now is a time for them to ask for help. Avery has been experiencing chronic pain that began as shoulder bursitis in May 2020, and ultimately had to quit their job. Despite going to physical therapy 3 days a week, their pain heightened, and fatigue continued for over an entire year of treatment. Finally in July 2021, they received a formal diagnosis that explained the widespread pain, inability to recover from injuries, and mind-boggling fatigue. They were diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic myofascial pain. Having to navigate the medical industrial complex has often left them feeling unheard and alone, going alone to multiple MRIs, xrays, blood tests, appointments with specialists, etc. throughout the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. While they wait for the state to decide if they are “disabled” they are not receiving any income, and are unable to work. I know firsthand how frustrating it has been for them to be home-bound, and the grief they are facing around the loss of the many hobbies and coping skills that have kept them grounded. As a queer survivor with PTSD, stable housing is something they haven’t always had, and the apartment they are in now is rent-stabilized, on the 1st floor, and within a block of an accessible subway station. Asking for help can be difficult, and I want to support Avery through this process by facilitating this GoFundMe. There are also some other ways to contribute to their care needs, and I’d encourage you to see the options below. Cash donations will be going to immediate needs of unpaid rent, utility bills, accessible school supplies, and medical costs. This fundraiser is meant to be ongoing, as their needs become more clear in the next few months. Funding will help them to be able to be more present for our mom, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last summer, and will allow them to have enough rest to control their pain threshold before going back to school in January. This fall they were accepted at the New School in Manhattan, where they have created a self-directed degree, focused on immigration law, and rooted in psychology and queer crip theory. They deferred their fall semester to allow for more time to hear back from social security, and have as much support as possible from disability services while going to school. Going back to school to complete their bachelor's is the reason Avery moved to NYC in March of 2020; despite the past year and half being shit, going to the New School is a dream. I know with the right support, they can still live that dream, and I’m hoping that they can get to January feeling cared for and heard.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-alicia-to-recover,Help Alicia to Recover," Thank you for visiting this page. We are in need of prayers and/or monetary support to help our loved one, Alicia Jacobs recover from a debilitating stroke. Alicia was diagnosed with COVID in September of 2021. The end of her COVID recovery presented with a shocking and scary condition. Alicia had developed a blood clot in her brain and pulmonary embolisms in the lungs. This is what caused a stroke on Sunday, October 3rd. She was life flighted to TriStar Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee which specializes in stroke care. Alicia was admitted into COVID ICU. She had left sided weakness and facial drooping. She failed the swallow study so needed a feeding tube to get nutrition. MRI showed swelling on the brain so they tried diuretics to help reduce the swelling. In the days that followed they had to do a craniotomy due to her brain shifting to the left from 4mm to 11mm. They removed a flap of her skull to allow room for the brain to swell instead of confining it. They sutured the flap inside the abdomen so when the swelling goes down, they can replace it. This is going to take some time (a few months we are being told). In the meantime, Alicia has also had to learn to speak and eat again. Alicia’s voice came back first. She is slow at processing and formulating her words but improving day by day with her speech therapy. It took three weeks but Alicia is eating soft foods again instead of all her nutrition coming through a tube. She has started physical therapy this week as her left side is partially paralyzed at this moment. She is starting to feel a little on that side though so that is promising news. Our Alicia is a fighter and we want to help her on this long road to recovery. It is anticipated that Alicia will spend most of, if not all of November in the hospital working on her therapy and recovery until she is able to transition to home care therapy. This is where we need any help possible. The medical and therapy expenses along with helping to make her home handicapped accessible will take a lot. We appreciate your prayers, good vibes and any help you can give. God bless you all! ",3045,5000,3 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/chavelys-kidney-infection-hospitalization,Chavely’s Kidney Infection Hospitalization," Purpose & Goal: These 1000.00 will help me alleviate some of my medical expenses due to an ER visit cause by a bad kidney infection. I am struggling with credit card debt due to the hospitalization and courses I have completed in order to further my education and get a job. This money would be extremely helpful to get back on my feet financially and be at a manageable spot. Direct Venmo is also available at: Chavely-Calleja-1My Story Hello, my name is Chavely and I am a recent Grinnell College graduate. While in Iowa I had Medicaid but moving back to Florida meant that I lost access to that and was unable to attain such medical coverage. I have been unemployed from June to September of this year and used much of my savings in order to receive my registered behavioral technician (RBT) certificate in order to start working with children who have learning disabilities. Much of my money went to applying to pass the exam, CPR/ First Aid and additional certifications. I started to have to put my expenses on my credit card and then mid-September I came down with a bad UTI. At one point I was peeing dark brown and even bits of coagulated blood. In an effort to limit my expenses I had an online consultation to receive antibiotics (45$). Yet, later I would find out that the antibiotics that were given to me where far too light to fully fight off the infection. To double check I went out of my way and payed out of pocket (250$) for a doctor’s visit that involved a urine culture after I finished my first antibiotic. Due to the fact that I took the urine culture the day after I stopped taking the antibiotics, the urine culture didn’t pick up the bit of infection that was still present, and everything came back negative, but I still had symptoms and they were getting worse leading to kidney pain. Around this time, I started a part-time job at a department store in my local area. Standing up all day and drinking minimal water in an effort to make money for all the credit card expenses I had accumulated for my health and further education – after a shift on October 2nd I went to the emergency room with the worst kidney pain I had ever experienced in my life. I was only there for 4 hours. They ran all the tests and even a CT abdomen and pelvis exam. Turns out I had a REALLY bad kidney infection (Pyelonephritis). IN CONCLUSION: I was sent home with a total of 5 prescription meds. Taking on average 8-10 pills a day for 14 days and I was again unable to work and was put on bedrest. I was able to get some of the medical bill taken off and was left with owing 2,890.95 + 295 (appointments). A total of 3,185.95$. I am in a good amount of debt with all the other things I have paid for and I finally starting to get better and slowly getting back to work. It took me putting a lot of my pride aside in order to make this GoFundMe. It would mean the world if I could get assistance paying a portion of this bill to alleviate some of the financial burden. Additionally, if anyone knows of some affordable healthcare options for a young adult in the state of Florida. I would love some help in order to set that up in the future. Thank you for reading this, sending you lots of Love, Health and Happiness ALWAYS <3 Chavely C. ",1348,1000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-allisons-cancer-treatment,Why Not Me?," Our dear friend Allison is again fighting cancer.   For those who don't know Allison's story in the summer of 2019 after dealing with back pain and numbness in her legs an MRI revealed a tumor on her spine.  Within 24 hours of receiving the MRI results she was in surgery to have the tumor removed.  She received a diagnosis of Ewings Sarcoma and went through 16 rounds of chemo and radiation.  Throughout her treatment she rarely missed work.  She often said that when life happens, the response is not ""why me, but why not me.""  In April of 2020 she got the great news that her tumor was gone and she was cancer free. (Although she did have to continue chemo treatments until July 2020.) While traveling this summer to see the Avett Brothers play Red Rocks she started having breathing difficulties.  Once home, routine blood test showed that something was off.   She spent her 40th birthday in the hospital getting a blood transfusion.  Allison was then diagnosed with  Myeloadysplastic Syndrome (MDS), a blood cancer caused by the chemotherapy she went through for her previous cancer. Allison treatment for MDS is chemotherapy and then a stem cell transplant.  She is currently on the third round of cancer treatment and has three more to go before she can recieve a stem cell transplant.  Chemo has been more difficult this time and Allison has spent many days in the hospital recently.  (Still working 8 hours days for work when she can and cross stitching to fend off boredom.)   Recently Allison learned more about what the stem cell transplant will entail. She will travel to Charlottesville for the transplant where she will be inpatient for one month as her new immune system is created. She will then have to stay in Charlottesville as an outpatient for two more months. Allison will be unable to work for these three months and need to find lodging in Charlottesville for the two months she is outpatient.   She will also have to be away from her amazing husband and three children during this time.  Allison is a fighter and her spirit continues to amaze us.  She is not one to ask for help and had to be convinced that she should  be open to us creating a GoFundMe.  Allison will need to deal with lost income on top of medical bills and additional housing cost for her treatment.   We hope that by alleviating some of the mental stress that these financial difficulties  bring, Allison can put all her energy in to getting better.  ",9220,15000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-teresa-battle-ovarian-cancer,Help Teresa Battle Ovarian Cancer,"Team fundraiserJen Soulé and 0 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Teresa Anne Volgenau. Hello, my name is Jen and I met Teresa Volgenau in Junior Girl Scouts in the 4th grade at Crest View Elementary School in Boulder, CO. We've been the closest of friends ever since. Teresa now lives in Westminster and she needs our help. After months of mysterious symptoms, gastrointestinal issues, and no answers, Teresa was diagnosed with ovarian cancer on Friday, October 15. It appears that it has advanced to some degree, but nothing will be fully known until surgery. Teresa is in amazing hands with Dr. Kian Behbakht  and his team at the University of Colorado Cancer Center. Her first surgery is scheduled for October 28 and will entail a full hysterectomy, removal of masses, and a possible bowel resection and ostomy formation. With this type of surgery, it is partially exploratory and the final outcome will not be known until after the surgery. The surgery is particularly challenging because exactly three years ago Teresa underwent another lifesaving abdominal surgery due to Peritonitis. As a result, there is a significant amount of scar tissue to work through. Due to this diagnosis and upcoming surgery, Teresa will experience a significant loss of income. She is currently in a considerable amount of discomfort but continues to smile and laugh with anyone in her presence. There is no doubt that Teresa is a warrior, but her ability to work is limited and she will not be able to work during the numerous weeks following surgery. Her final treatment plan is yet to be determined. As many of you know, Teresa is full of life, a passionate artist, and after an extensive career in the performing arts she continues to coach dancers... and she is self-employed. If she takes time off, she has no income. In order to alleviate the stress of losing the majority of her income and to help pay for medical expenses, I have set up this GoFundMe page. If you would like to support her, all proceeds will be deposited directly into her account. Teresa is an amazing visual artist and if you have been thinking about purchasing artwork from her, now is the time! You can view her work that's available for sale here: https://www.tavolgenau.com/shop-artAs we have updates, we'll post them here. ",19116,20000,16-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/love-for-lori-support-the-bristow-family,Help with Bristows' medical expenses #LoveForLori," Lori is the loving wife of Jack and dedicated mother of her sons Austin and Alec. Lori works as a librarian for the high school and has previously worked in local retail stores and coached St. Mary's Catholic School cheerleading. Her husband Jack has taught law enforcement at the high school since 2002, formerly coached basketball, and served as a city police officer and DARE officer prior to that. Lori and Jack have been active in their church and the community. In November 2020, Lori was diagnosed with cardiac AL amyloidosis, a rare disease where the bone marrow produces proteins that attach to the heart, causing it to harden and lose function and which is fatal if not treated. While undergoing testing at Mayo Clinic in December 2020, doctors discovered sarcoidosis in her lungs and heart as well as thyroid cancer. Lori has undergone numerous tests and procedures, including installation of a pacemaker/defibrillator device, chemotherapy and several different medications. The funds being raised will help provide for Lori’s medical care and related expenses that arise as her treatment continues. She still will endure more medical appointments, consultations, tests, procedures, and thyroid surgery as well as the costs of expenses associated with her treatments such as travel from central Illinois to local appointments and visits to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. It is hoped this fundraiser will help relieve at least a portion of their burden. Click here to read their journal about Lori's journey on CaringBridge.org. Each and every donation is appreciated.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/keeping-ben-safe,Keeping Ben Safe," When Ben was a baby, he was the most peaceful and happy little guy. A dimply smile and easy to laugh. He was a dream come true! By the time Ben turned two I had found us in a situation of needing to get away from his father, who was growing more and more violent by the day. 18 years of heavy drinking had finally taken its toll and I no longer recognized the man we lived with. Of the four kids, Benjamin seemed to get targeted by his Father the most. By the time I was able to leave in 2019 Benjamin had been thrown to the floor, strangled and drug down a hallway by his neck, and bruised. He was three. My other children experienced terror from their father as well. Holes punched next to their faces, broken belongings, and physical punishment. My children (8 and 6 at the time) developed an emergency plan to escape their father when I wasn't around to keep them safe. The day I asked for a divorce, Ben's father threw Ben to show me I had no power and things would get worse. The events that unfolded were from a nightmare. It took me a year to escape and get the children safe. Or so I thought. After the divorce Ben's father continued to target him. Eventually, this landed Ben in the hospital after his dad held him to the ground, with his full force on his chest until Ben couldn't breathe. He struggled to breathe or speak and eventually was let up. He later told DHS and me he thought it was his last moments. I have pursued immediate danger orders along with opening DHS cases. We have gone to trial. And despite mountains of evidence and countless professionals saying he is in danger, the courts won't grant ongoing safety for my children. Ben is now 6 years old. He has tried to take his own life multiple times and this has landed him in a Children's Emergency Room for 6 nights. He continually self harms and has been diagnosed with severe PTSD. He's 6 years old. With PTSD. My first grader needs an on-call suicide prevention specialist to visit the house once a week to keep him safe. His words to me were ""Why should I love myself when my Dad doesn't?"" The most recent events have caused Ben to land back in the hospital for suicide ideation, and I am in need of a lawyer to pursue safety for my children again. Their father does not pay anything medical, dental or psychological bills (despite being ordered to) so this is all up to me. Each night in the hospital cost us $$$. To get started, the lawyer will be $6,000. The fees go up from there. I have pursued free legal aid and they are weeks out, but we need help now! We are asking for small amounts of help to hopefully chip away at this mountain of debt while we focus on keeping Benjamin alive, safe, and healthy. We know how hard everyone has it right now, and how incredibly hard everyone works. We take every donation with a grateful heart and promise it will go directly to paying to keep him safe. We thank you! -Ben and Meg ",5875,6000,21-Oct-21

My name is Candice Smith-Collins and my daughter, Asiannia Smith is currently in the hospital due to complications of Covid-19. She was diagnosed on August 7, 2021. Before that she learned she had severe congestive heart failure. She developed pneumonia in both lungs and built up fluid around her heart. Since the diagnosis, she has been in and out of the hospital. October 2, 2021 she went back into the hospital at Fairview Park Hospital in Dublin, Ga due to difficulty breathing and vomiting blood. October 4, 2021, she went into cardiac arrest and coded. They were able to stabilize her, but she had to be put on a ventilator. On October 6, 2021, she was transferred to Emory University in Atlanta, Ga for advanced care. Asiannia has one year old twin boys, Jayden & Jaylen. My husband and I are their primary caregivers. Since this tragedy struck my family, I have been out of work on FMLA without pay. This has caused tremendous financial hardship. I am the sole provider due to my husband being disabled due to kidney disease. She's currently having a hard time breathing, her anxiety level is up, her heart rate is up, and blood pressure is elevated. She has a fever that has not been broken and has to wear a cooling blanket to cool her body down. She had to be put on a feeding tube to get the nutrients that she needs. All funds donated will go towards the care of her babies, food, bills, insurance, lodging and transportation back and forth from Dublin, Ga to Atlanta, Ga. Anybody that knows me, knows that I hate asking for help but this nightmare is out of my control and my family is in need of help. No amount is to small.

Recently, Chris was diagnosed with stage 4 small cell lung cancer that metastasized to the pituitary gland in the brain. The nightmare began a few weeks back when Chris was rushed to the emergency room with excruciating pain in his eye. Scans picked up the tumors and he was admitted into Allegheny General to undergo a biopsy that would identify the stage of the lung cancer. Needless to say, this was devastating to all who know and love him, but, especially to his wife of 37 years, Emily.  She and Chris vow to beat this with everything they have. They have been together since age 14 and married at 21, and have a son named C.J.  Chris has served as a volunteer fire fighter for the City of New Kensington – Parnassus 56-2 and is also employed as a security guard, but he doesn’t have medical insurance and isn’t able to work now due to this invasive disease. One can only imagine the financial burdens they will face with medical bills, prescription costs and traveling expenses as he undergoes intense chemotherapy and radiation. Will you find it in your heart to help these incredible people? They are good people who have endured and surpassed many struggles. However, this is one that will require a lot of support. Please help us alleviate some of the stress they face and please pray for them at every opportunity. Thank you and God bless you all. ",9975,8000,17-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-marissa-kick-cancer-to-the-curb,Help Marissa Kick Cancer to the Curb,"Liz Austin is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Marissa Gailey. You're here because you want to help Marissa - a woman who has gone above and beyond the call of duty to help others. Marissa needs our help to cover the cost of urgent medical costs tied to a cancer diagnosis and corresponding IVF treatments.  Marissa spends her days and nights providing critical medical care to our most vulnerable: babies and kids who walk through the doors of Children's Hospital emergency room. Marissa comforts parents who are scared about medical outcomes of their kids, provides rockstar care to those children, and grieves alongside families going through some of their darkest times. It is our turn to comfort Marissa, to help provide her care, and walk with her through this next challenging chapter. Two weeks ago Marissa received devastating and unexpected news. Her doctors diagnosed her with stage four colon cancer that metastasized and traveled to her liver and lymph nodes. Marissa is on the eve of her 33rd birthday and just begining to dive into all that life has to offer. For the month prior to the diagnosis Marissa was planning to start travel nursing to areas hit the hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic in the wake of the Delta surge. Her boyfriend, Jeremy, was ready to support her in this next adventure and take steps towards planning their life together. As you can imagine, this serious diagnosis halted Marissa's and Jeremy's plans in their tracks. Instead, she is pivoting to emergency IVF treatment to preserve the possibility of one day starting a family of her own. This treatment is necessary and unavoidable given the intensity of the chemo treatments Marissa is facing. As someone who has spent the last decade caring for children, preservation of her future mom-self is critically important to Marissa. As many of you reading this I'm sure are aware, insurance rarely covers IVF procedures and medications, even in extreme and urgent situations such as Marissa's. Marissa is therefore facing the pressures and anxiety of covering that IVF treatment out of pocket on top of paying her out-of-pocket costs for her cancer treatments. Marissa is a fighter, strong and relentless. So is the community that supports her. For those reasons, we are not going to talk about outcomes, risks, and probabilities. We are here to speak hope into life. We hope that her community rallies and grows. We hope for miracles in her recovery and miracles in the support that shows up for her. We hope Marissa gets the future she dreams of, and that you all are there to enjoy it with her. ",55330,35000,16-Aug-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-stephen-muzzy-kick-cancers-ass,Help Stevie Muzzy Kick Cancer’s Ass!," Our dear Stephen Muzzonigro, “MUZZY”, brother, and friend experienced unusual neurological symptoms about a month ago. What we originally thought might be a potential brain abscess from a tooth infection was revealed through a CT scan and MRI to be a 3.5 cm brain tumor. Stevie underwent emergency brain surgery and removal of a large primary brain tumor through a craniotomy at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla. His surgery went extremely well. In classic Stevie fashion, he hiked to the top of Runyon Canyon less than a week post-op. Shortly after, his pathology came back as a malignant Glioblastoma, grade 4, a fast-growing type of brain cancer. Fortunately, Stevie has led an extraordinarily healthy and positive lifestyle. With his fiery soul, we are certain that his unique physical and spiritual abilities in combination with his family and friends network, can help him overcome this rare medical condition. He will require the abundant love and support of his friends and family during this challenging period. Stevie will proceed with a set regiment of focused radiation therapy used in conjunction with daily chemotherapy to give him the best odds of clearing the cancer from his system. This also comes with a very specific diet aimed at starving the cancer at the recommendation of some of the world's leading Naturopathic doctors. The treatments are and will be: mentally, physically and emotionally exhausting, and so far, Stephen is meeting these challenges in every way. There are several extremely important treatments/supplements that are required and that have incredible potential to aid in the clearing of this cancer from his body which unfortunately are not covered by insurance. We humbly ask for your help and support; please join our fight and be part of Stevie's winning team. Stevie has spent his entire life helping others. He may have been diagnosed with a rare disease; however, it's Stephen’s rare heart and energy that has been a source of love and light to anyone's life he touches. Thanks for all your love, prayers, care and generosity. With appreciation, Stephen’s Family ",7565,175000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-team-grace,Team Grace,"Courtney Brown is organizing this fundraiser.Grace Dillinger came into this world as a 2 lb micro-preemie baby, exceeding expectations of many doctors who didn’t believe she would make it. If you’ve followed along with her story, you know that she was born with severely underdeveloped lungs resulting in chronic lung disease/BPD which has caused her many challenges. Her entire NICU journey has been full of ups and downs, but sadly, after recent events, it’s been made known that Grace’s underlying Chronic Lung Disease is significantly worse than anticipated. In September, things took a drastic turn for Grace where her parents, Calvin & Bradi, were told she was not likely to make it through the night - on more than one occasion. Through much prayer, God’s mercy and an amazing medical team - Grace pulled through what seemed to be the impossible. Because of the new reality of her condition, once she reached stability, the quick next steps for Grace were a Tracheostomy and Gastrostomy Tube to support her moving forward. This is a major medical intervention that will require years of focused 24/7 medical support for Grace. While Grace’s parents are so thankful that Grace is here with them in the NICU, they are anxious and eager to bring her home. This new development means that they will need a significantly increased level of support for Grace once she comes home. Calvin & Bradi are so grateful for the support and love that has already been poured out to them but this is a long, painful and expensive journey. As a community of friends, family, and loved ones, who want so desperately to help this family, we cannot be in the NICU advocating for Grace with them. We arent there learning her trach care, or managing physicians and specialists, or performing hours of bedside care. But we can take some practical things off their shoulders to offer space and time for them to focus on Grace and her healing journey. Our goal is that we can offer support to meet some practical needs, so they can be fully present with Grace and get their home prepared to bring home a “medically complex” baby.  While Calvin & Bradi have worked diligently to save and prepare for emergencies - it's safe to say nothing could have prepared them for this situation. I started this GoFundMe page to provide an opportunity for those desiring to encourage the Dillingers during this difficult time. Any amount is a blessing to their family. Calvin and Bradi passed along some of the practical things these funds would go towards below: 1. They will need to purchase a vehicle to accommodate Grace's medical equipment. 2. While insurance should cover a large portion of the medical expenses - they have extensive medical bills and a number of out-of-pocket expenses related to Grace’s needs. 3. They will need to semi-renovate the bottom floor of their house to have a bedroom for Grace and a dedicated caregiver (She will need 24-hour care while she has her trach, g-tube, and ventilator).4. With Grace’s early arrival and the need to be quarantined over the last 4+ months, they have not had an opportunity to have a baby shower or to get many of the normal first baby items. 5. Last but not least with Bradi taking an extended leave of absence from work any unexpected expenses will have a larger impact on the family. Thank you for your love, generosity, and support as the Dillinger’s eagerly prepare to bring their miracle girl home.",23967,1,5-Oct-21

Then being transferred to a hospital, then the local children's hospital, then the specialty children's hospital 2 hours away and after 48 hours finding out the injury is Retinoblastoma - an aggressive eye cancer - and finding out your 4-year-old will need to have his eye removed immediately to save his life.  On top of the whirlwind 3 days of trying to occupy your child while he can't eat all day because of MRI's, surgery and other medical procedures, you know in the back of your mind, you are racking up medical expenses at the rate of several thousand dollars a day, while burning through leave time for you, your child's father and loving step-parents. This is what my sister has faced this week. What started out as a happy Sunday - we were supposed to take our 4 boys to the movies - led to him getting his eye removed on Wednesday, October 20. Fortunately, the prognosis is good and the doctor feels confident they got all the cancer removed, but we will know for sure in 10 days when the pathology report is back. In 6 weeks, Evan will be fitted for his new ""superhero eye"" that will match his existing eye. Many of you have asked how you can help and the biggest way to help right now is to donate to defray some of the medical expenses for Evan's treatment.  While the prognosis seems positive, there are still a lot of expenses between the surgery, tests and prosthetic. Thank you for your kindness and for helping out. ",3275,4000,21-Oct-21

Chris Flisher, artist, renowned astrologer, and beloved family man has been dealt a heavy hand. Many years ago, Chris lost his wife and mother of his three sons to an aggressive form of brain cancer, a glioblastoma. This past October, Chris started experiencing strange symptoms—typos in his writing, confusion, and extreme fatigue. A CT scan revealed the shocking news that Chris had a large mass in his brain which turned out to be a glioblastoma, the same type of tumor as his wife. Chris, his family and his partner Sue knew what they were in for. He immediately embarked on the standard treatment regime: brain surgery, chemo and radiation and then signed up for a clinical trial. These treatments worked well initially, but in the past month, he started to decline and has now suffered a total loss of mobility, requiring the use of a wheelchair and around-the-clock care. Costs have been mounting as Sue equipped their home with a hospital bed, a motorized stair lift, and anything else that would make him comfortable or aid in his treatment, even purchasing a handicap-accessible van so he could still get out and see the world. We are hoping to raise money to provide continued care for Chris. His comfort and quality of life are top priority as he faces down this all too familiar enemy. For those of you that know him, you know just how special Chris really is. His colorful spirit, sense of humor, and genuine empathy for others has allowed him to find a place in so many people's hearts. After a lifetime of giving to others, we are now hoping to give back to Chris in any way we can. The money raised will go towards in-home care, equipment, medical, hospital, and living expenses.

Autumn Waack, just 18 years old, has very recently been diagnosed with an aggressive very rare, stage four metastatic cancer.  This cancer came out of nowhere and a healthy, vibrant college freshman is now facing an unimaginable battle.  This fundraiser is designed to provide Autumn with all the financial support she needs and to allow her mother (Denise) the freedom to be at her side, cheering Autumn on and caring for her.Autumn is a bright and incredibly kind young woman who is passionate in her love of animals. She graduated from Cheryl Stockwell Academy in Brighton, MI and had just started college at Wayne State University.  She was looking ahead towards a promising collegiate volleyball career that is now placed on hold.  Since discovering that she has cancer, she has told her mom that she would rather it happen to her instead of someone else because she would never want anyone to have to go through this.  That is just one example of how big-hearted this incredible young woman is!  Autumn has planned to put her natural kindness into action through pursuing a psychology degree and eventually entering a helping profession such as counseling. As a freshman she was just beginning to stretch her wings and explore future pathways - and then a stomach ache and some vomiting led to this completely unexpected diagnosis. Autumn lives 100% with her mom and her brother, Bailey. Denise is a single mom and therapist. As a contractor she does not get paid if she is unable to work. Denise has always been the sole provider of support for her children.  #TeamAutumn friends and family want Denise to have the money she needs to step away from work and spend time with Autumn and care for her - without risking losing their home. The money raised here will go directly to pay for the home where Autumn lives, the food Autumn eats and Autumn's medical expenses. All funds go directly to Denise, Autumn's mom and guardian, in direct support of Autumn's care.Autumn is receiving treatment at University of Michigan Mott's Children's Hospital, and though a treatment plan is still developing, given the severity of the cancer - treatment will be tough and will start as soon as possible.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/phil-ranelin-fundraiser,PHIL RANELIN FUNDRAISER,"Stephen Auerbach is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Trudy Burnett.  Phil Ranelin Needs our Love and Support!  Legendary jazz musician Phil Ranelin recently suffered a debilitating stroke.  Phil has been a wonderful friend to all of us and an inspiration to reach for your goals through his fantastic music.  He's given so much, but now Phil needs each and everyone of us.  The Vibe Tribe Shows Up!  Phil recently did what he loves the most - thrilled an audience with a Charlie Parker tribute concert at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.  Phil knew something wasn't right as he was feeling weak during the show.  Soon after the stroke hit our friend and now he's laid up in a care facility.  He's doing fairly well mentally but physical he's paralyzed on one side and unable to get around. We are hoping to raise 50,000 dollars for this great man.  We know that there are many in Phil's Vibe Tribe, so if can encourage 1000 of your tribe-sters to give fifty dollars each, Phil and his loving family, led by his loving daughters Trudy and Tracy, can rest easy for a year or two, knowing that he can mend and continue to be the great friend that we all know and love. Let's be real - Phil is a jazz musician.  He's not exactly a Rockefeller if you get what I mean.  He's in it for the love and his spiritual gift has been to create music for all of us regardless of the financial burdens being a true artist often entails. Phil is a loving and humble man. We all know that. Now's the time to step up and help us raise the funds so that Phil can: 1 - Move to a better long term care facility. The joint he is in right now is not up to any of our standards. 2 - Have his therapy and bills paid for as he heals. 3 - Eventually move back to Indiana where his wonderful family can be nearby and take care of his every need on this road to recovery. For now Phil's music may be silenced, but his heart is not.  He loves you all and wants you to know that he wishes he could be the one helping others, as he has so often in the past. So here we go, hit play on Phil's classic composition JAMAICAN SUNRISE and take the time to show up for Phil, our brother, our friend, our father and our man, Phil Ranelin ! Thank you from Phil's family.   We can do it!""Jamaican Sunrise,"" Phil Ranelin and Friendsp.s. Please share this campaign on your facebook or other social media so that the word can get out.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-fight-for-aria-for-her-health,"A fight for Aria, for her Health!"," Hello everyone, We have created this fund to help our daughter Aria. Aria Maxine is 5 years old and 1st grade (infant 1).  She is a bright student and a sweetheart. As some of you may already know. Aria started suffering from Blackouts in April of 2020.  She had 3 episodes each one lasting a little longer than the last. Being in the middle of a complete Island lockdown there was not much we can do. Our Doctor on the island did many tests and thought she was maybe dehydrated.... In October 2020 Aria had another blackout only this time her entire body went stiff and her eyes rolled back, it was a Saturday so we rushed her to our Emergency care at our Polyclinic. The Dr. on duty asked me all the questions and specifically asked me about Aria's birth (Aria was born at 36 weeks through an emergencyc section because she had the umbilical chord around her neck).He concluded that he did believe Aria had a seizure and reccomended that i take her to Belize City for a Cat Scan. Aria saw a neurologist who agreed she has been having seizures. her Cat Scan did not show any reason as to why she was having the seizures so therefore her diagnosis remained inconclusive. Aria then began treatment to control the seizures. So there really never a diagnosis for Aria. After months of treatment with Valporic Acid her Liver test (which was done every 2 months) showed that the medication was affecting her Liver so we had to change medication.  After almost being seizure free for a year Aria had another Seizure on October 17th. It is imperative that Aria has the proper tests to diagnose her condition. Therefore, she needs be under the care of Pediatric Neurologist  ... Unfortunately these services are unavailable  in the country of Belize so we must make other arrangements.  Fortunately, We have found a specialist that is located in Merida Mexico but we need your help The past 2 years have been extremely difficult for my family.between no tourists coming to the island and Roberto loosing his job. We have done everything we can as parents to survive and have our kids comfortable during this pandemic. However this is beyond us. I know the hard times have affected everyone but if you can donate we will be forever grateful. Thank you Roberto & Kristi ",6465,10000,3 days

On Wednesday October 20, my Dad was taken by ambulance to the emergency room. He was complaining of intense stomach pain and he couldn’t breath. He stayed in the ER for a couple days before a bed in the ICU opened up. What started out as pneumonia and fluid in his lungs has turned into so much worse. During a CT scan they discovered a hole in his intestines.  They had emergency surgery to repair the hole but so much damage had been done. He’s currently in the ICU fighting off an infection that’s causing septic shock. They have tubes inserted to try and drain the fluids but there are still issues with the right lung. He has been sedated and on a ventilator since the first night. Yesterday they lifted sedation but he didn’t respond much. They did a CT Scan today on his brain that shows it is functioning normally. We haven’t lost hope but it’s clear there is a long road ahead. I know my parents wouldn’t reach out for help but I know they’ll need it. The dr bills will be high and My mom will be missing work.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-support-brian-shawna-and-family,"Please support Brian, Shawna and family","Brianne Temple is organizing this fundraiser.Three weeks ago, Brian was given the heartbreaking news that he has brain cancer. This was shocking and left so many questions unanswered. When Brian tested positive for Covid, it made things even more difficult. He was transported to Hartford Hospital where he was placed in a Covid unit. He had another MRI, a biopsy and was put on high doses of steroids to shrink the tumors. Everyone waited for answers. Through all of this waiting and worrying, with Covid restrictions, Brian spent so much time alone.  Test results confirmed that Brian has CNS lymphoma which is a rare non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. It is an aggressive and fast growing cancer. Once Brian’s immune system recovered from Covid, he was able to start his treatment. He will receive several cycles of chemo throughout the next few months. He had his first cycle of chemo on October 5th. Although this is an incredibly difficult time for him, he responded very well!! He was able to come home to his family just five days later! Brian will continue with his treatment at Backus, where he will need to be admitted to the hospital during his cycle weeks. This is the beginning of a long journey for him and his family. The outpouring of love and support has been amazing and both Brian and Shawna are grateful for all of you. Since Brian will not be returning to work for sometime, we are asking for donations to lessen the financial burden the family will endure during this difficult time. Please continue to keep Brian, Shawna and family in your prayers.  ",16121,20000,15-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/jennifer-got-lemons-lets-help-her-make-lemonade,"Jennifer got lemons, lets help her make lemonade"," Dear Friends, Many of you know my best friend, Jennifer Jobe, and if you do, you also know she's about as awesome as someone can be. I have had the honor of having her as my friend since we were 13, and at this point calling her my ""friend"" isn't a strong enough word... she is my sister. This week she got some pretty devastating news about her health, and true to form, has faced it head-on with the strength and fearlessness that I have spent most of my life being awestruck by. For her privacy I won't be sharing the full specifics of her situation (as she is also still learning more every day), but she has a pretty daunting road of recovery ahead of her due to an unexpected emergency surgery followed by a diagnosis of colon cancer. If you know her, you also know Jennifer has spent the last 15 years as a Jr. High math teacher—a true higher calling as far as I'm concerned. But we also know that teachers aren't paid nearly what they deserve... and this is where you come in. Even with insurance, her current bills from the one surgery so far (more will be required) will be beyond what she is able to afford without essentially clearing out the savings that I've seen her work so hard to accumulate. Without a second income in her home and without medical disability insurance, the days that she will miss for any additional surgery, recovery and treatments will be unpaid time off, making the financial side of this journey a pretty uncertain one. If we all put in a little, it will add up to a lot, so I am asking that you donate what you can. I am hoping that we can pull together enough to take some of the financial burden off of her shoulders so she can focus on healing and recovery. Thank you! Nuance Elliott ",2620,10000,1 day

The insurance covers 80%, leaving a huge expense to the family.  Without Jason’s income, the family will need much help from friends and family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ricky-russell-medical-expenses,Ricky Russell Medical Expenses,"Team fundraiserCharlene Hovsepian Theriault and 2 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Rick and Cindy Russell. Hi all, It’s never easy to ask for help, but we are reaching out to you on behalf of our friend, Ricky Russell. All of us were devastated when Ricky was first diagnosed Wegener's Granulomatosis. It was heartbreaking to hear the goal he set for himself, to see both Chloe and Colby graduate high school based on what the doctors shared with him of life expectancy. He and Cindy got his affairs in order, anytime one of us asked him if he needed help, he would decline telling us when he is gone it will all be okay. Ricky was able to achieve his goal of attending the kids High School graduation! The BEST news came in late fall 2020 when his treatments have been successful, prognosis is good and he is IN REMISSION! Isn't it wonderful to know Ricky will continue to be with all of us, his friends from so many walks of life and beautiful family for many more milestones and celebrations! With this wonderful news, comes some hardship as well. We all knew that his illness has made him unable to work. Throughout the years, out of pocket costs have mounted, couple that with anticipated future treatments costs, it is placing a large financial burden for the family. That is where we all come in! Ricky has always been there for all of us in so many ways. He’s always there to lend a helping hand. This is where we all come in to be there for him. We’re asking all friends and family to contribute whatever you can to help cover the cost of the paying off the past treatment and to help with the continuation of his treatments. We wouldn’t ask this if it weren’t necessary and anything you can give would be a real blessing. Please donate here on the Go Fund Me we have set up.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-dani-in-her-fight-to-a-full-recovery,Help Danibeth in her Fight to Walk Again," Hi, my name is Christina and I am fundraising for Danibeth Wheeler, one of the kindest, most selfless people any of us have ever met.  As many of you know by now, Dani was in a bizarre, unfortunate car accident on Saturday, October 16th during a moment where she was doing what she does best: helping a friend in-need. On site, Dani was found in critical, life-threatening condition next to her car, which ended up needing to be towed after hitting a tree. She was immediately taken to Concord Hospital, and then rushed to Dartmouth Hitchcock in Lebanon because of the severity of her injuries. This is where her long journey of recovery began. Dani originally suffered from internal bleeding, a broken arm, a shattered pelvis, and many lower-body lacerations (among other critical medical injuries). Since the accident, she’s had multiple surgeries, with more scheduled in her future. As of now, Dani has months and months of recovery ahead of her, will require frequent visits to the hospital long after her discharge, and will suffer permanent, life-changing medical damage.  If you are lucky enough to know Dani, you know she is the person you go to for anything. She would give the clothes off of her back or lend money to a friend if it meant she could make someone else’s situation more pleasant. She puts everyone in her life before herself. For instance, at the hair salon, she happily works long hours to fulfill the needs of her booming clientele, and provides a friendly ear, listening and offering support to her trusting patrons. In the past, on her day-off, she’s volunteered at the Elks to raise money for charity. She is community-oriented, doing her best on a daily basis to help those most in-need.  More intimately, Dani is the person friends and family go to for advice, emotional support, and navigating through the trivialities of everyday life. She’s continually there for friends during the day-to-day and special events like: helping to purchase a car (we all know Dani is definitely the person you want as your right-hand-man during one of the largest purchases in your life); making her very special finger sandwiches and potato salad upon request (and they are ALWAYS requested) for every birthday party, wedding shower, holiday event, and/or get-together; offering to plan, organize, cater, and run major parties in her loved ones’ lives in order to make their wildest dreams come true during their most momentous day; and on the day-to-day she’s there for any needs as Dani can literally do anything. With a smile on her face, she does all this and more while never complaining about how much work we all ask of her and never asking for any monetary support. Dani is a strong, independent person with an obvious drive to help those in need; yet, she never asks much of anyone. At this moment, she needs our support to be there for her during her time of dire urgency. Like many Americans and small business owners, Dani does not have health insurance. Although the immediate issue is making sure Dani will heal as well as she can, the reality is that at some point, even the most financially responsible individual (like Dani) will have financial hardship paying back the hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills. Luckily, we can help alleviate some of this burden by cashing in on all the “I owe you one” accumulated from all the favors Dani has done for us in the past.  Your donation will support Dani as she gets back on her feet. Because of the severity of her injuries, Dani will be out of work for the foreseeable future, and thus unable to contribute financially to her family. So, not only will your contribution help pay for the astronomical medical bills the future holds, but for immediate, every day financial concerns like: the mortgage for Dani and Jim’s brand new house, utilities, repairing the car, groceries, and other living expenses. We all know the strain financial insecurity places on a person, and Dani and Jim need to put all their energy into Dani’s health and well-being. Please help this beautiful family during this incredibly difficult time in their lives. Dani would never ask anyone to help her, but she doesn’t need to ask. She needs us and we want to help in any way we can.  Please consider donating (we welcome any contribution that is financially appropriate to your situation) to help minimize the financial burden on Dani and Jim so they are able to focus on what's most important: Dani's health and recovery. Thank you for your support.  ",14420,100000,6 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jacob-with-his-fight-against-osteosarcoma,Help Jacob with his fight against  Osteosarcoma,"Maggie Sullivan is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Margaret Yates. Jacob Yates is like any other teenager/young adult, full of happiness, liked to make people laugh while personally battling teenage awkwardness. Raised in the Channahon / Minooka IL area, he is a middle child, with 3 other siblings that grew up closely knitted to each other. Jacob loves computer gaming and has a passion for cooking. Working since he was 16 in a local restaurant kitchen, Jacob has big plans for the future, to reach his goal to own his own restaurant someday as well as learn to fly an airplane. Sadly, however, his hope now is to simply take at least one ride in an airplane as he was hit with the news on May 10th, 2021 that he has cancer and it is a rare form of Osteosarcoma (Bone Cancer) found mostly in children and young adults. When it began: What started out as back pain in early February of 2021, Jacob started to see a chiropractor and was being treated for sciatica with pain in the back traveling down his legs. Unbeknownst to us and giving his age and unawareness of the need for concerns of anything other than sciatic problems, his muscle in his left leg started to get bigger…and quickly. After a visit with his general physician in April, he was given pain meds and steroids to help with the hope to relieve the pain and told to come back in 30 days. No physical examination of the body was given nor an X-ray of his back so sadly we were all unaware of what was about to happen. As the pain got worse and unbearable Jacob went back and was sent to a hospital in the Chicago area on May 10th, 2021. It was then that we found out a large tumor, almost the size of a kid nerf football developed on his leg and as well as 3-4 growths on his lungs. A week later after the PET Scan was done the finding showed 14-16 growths on his lung as well as on his spine wrapping like a thread around his T9. Jacob has a big heart and was full of trust in the hospital he is at and the doctors who are treating him. Being that he was considered an adult at 19, he chose to not get 2nd option as he feared it would delay the possibility of treatment and getting better…as parents, it was out of our hands to get them ourselves as other Dr's couldn’t speak to us without his permission. It took over a month before the hospital decided the type of treatment to give him due to how rare his type of Osteosarcoma was but on June 11th we finally started chemotherapy which due to the intensity required him to stay in the hospital for each round. On June 14th, ready to go home from treatment, Jacob sneezed…causing him to break the femur in his leg that the tumor was sitting on. Since then we have battled many challenges causing a great deal of delays in obtaining his treatments. His ability to handle the treatments was strong and hopeful with the only major issue being his ability to maintain or gain weight to receive them. Jacob was told there was no need for concern for the lungs and T9, the focus was on the leg and we were all very excited to watch as the tumor in the leg go down to what we could see to be the size of a baseball but we had to get to week 10 still of the therapy for scans to be completed. Jacob's depression was lifting and he was still holding onto his dreams and goals…making plans for the future! He celebrated his 20th birthday with happiness and hope in August. Sadly the happiness and hope has come to an end when he had to go back in for pain and back spasms on August 26th. After various scans, we found out that although the tumor in the leg has shown great success….the growth in the lungs and back had grown massively. Jacob was told on September 2nd that he is terminal and was given options for comfort for the rest of his days. Jacob was received 10 days of radiation and 1 round of chemotherapy and as of September 16th we have only had 9 for the needed 27 chemo treatments he was supposed to obtain, it appears the lungs are not responsive to the treatments. Part of the treatment needed has been denied by the insurance and costs for a 30 days supplies over $20,000 and it seems the hospital isn't looking for other treatments for him...that it was this treatment or nothing. Jacob isn’t giving up, he is a fighter, he wants to live and trying so hard to hold on to the hope of living a long life that he has given us the power of attorney so that we can start to look for other Drs that are willing to fight and find a way to save him. We don’t have much but we’ve always tried to give our kids everything we can and try to do it without the help of others as we understand financial struggles and how expensive it is to just function in society today. We know there is no cure for cancer but to get to a state of remission and continue and experience a long life is all that Jacob and the rest of his family prayer for...ok and for a cure but we take what we can get. With that being said it is with a heavy-aching heart that we now have to turn to others and ask for help. We have lost a great deal of income from missing work during this time period and although we were able to cover the expenses and needs outside of what was not covered by insurance, the money is almost gone. We now have to hide our pride and are asking for whatever help we can get to assist in paying for this current needed treatment as well as to help cover other medical bills and expenses we will need to spend to take him to other hospitals thru out the state of Illinois and if needed the country to find a treatment and save his life. Any assist would be greatly appreciated as even the smallest amount helps in getting him and us on his path to healing as soon as possible as the clock is against us. We also are asking for prayers, as many prayers as we can get so God can hear us and help Jacob with his fight against cancer! ",21515,40000,16-Sep-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/gn456-help-ericka,Ayudemos a Ericka con su gasto de hospitalización,"Ursula Damico is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Vincenzo D’Amico.Ericka Perez tenía 36 semanas de embarazo cuando contrajo Covid-19 y tuvieron que llevarla a emergencia donde luego de una evaluación pulmonar crítica tuvieron que practicarle una cesárea preventiva para salvaguardar la vida de su bebé. Francesca D’Amico Pérez nació sin poder conocer a su madre ya que el pulmón derecho de Ericka dejó de funcionar, lo que obligó a los médicos a colocarlas en terapia intensiva. Luego de 8 días de evaluación y cuidados Francesca pudo volver a casa con su padre Andrea D’Amico, mientras que Ericka se mantiene estable gracias a una máquina de alto flujo de última generación en la clínica Metropolitana. Ericka lleva más de 24 días hospitalizada (desde el 21 de Septiembre) y nuestro seguro de gastos médicos dejó de cubrir la hospitalización por la cantidad de días que lleva internada, sin tener la certeza aún de los que faltan. Hoy, la proyección de gastos supera los USD 100,000  y necesitamos cada apoyo posible para superar este difícil momento.  Queremos que Ericka se recupere, que Francesca pueda crecer con su mamá al lado y que pronto puedan estar reunidas con su papá y esposo: Andrea, así como su familia y amigos. Te necesitamos para lograr sortear esta emergencia y pagar esta cantidad de gastos. Gracias por cada apoyo, cada share, cada aporte. TODO suma, y NINGÚN monto ni ninguna acción son pequeñas. Los necesitamos a todos. Más que nunca. Gracias.Actualización - 25 de Octubre -No tenemos palabras para agradecer todo el apoyo y el cariño incondicional que hemos recibido de parte de todos ustedes. Apreciamos enormemente todos los esfuerzos que se han hecho para ayudarnos, estamos realmente conmovidos y agradecidos de corazón.Queremos mantenerlos informados de nuestra situación actualmente ya que conforme avanzó el tiempo, nuestra Ericka ha reaccionado positivamente a los estímulos de los tratamientos del cual rescatamos principalmente el amor.Luego de que Ericka conociera a Francesca, su mejoría fué milagrosa. Poco a poco pudo dejar la sedación y sus niveles de oxigenación empezaron a estabilizarse permitiéndole a los médicos evaluar el panorama rumbo a su recuperación fuera de terapia Intensiva.Todo se definiría si los pulmones de Ericka lograban soportar el flujo del Cpap (una máquina de menos intensidad), dándole luz verde para ser trasladada a una habitación donde pudiese continuar su mejoría. El miércoles 20 de octubre Ericka tuvo la fortaleza para ser trasladada con cuidados especiales de 24 horas a cargo de una enfermera a la comodidad de una habitación de la policlínica. Actualmente está estable, aprendiendo a respirar nuevamente, a mover su cuerpo con seguridad y a digerir todo lo que ha pasado. Aunque no está fuera de peligro, nuestra visión es optimista, Ericka realmente es un milagro, como dicen sus médicos.Para el día 18 de Octubre, la cuenta que debíamos al Hospital era de 65.000$ , día que se nos notificó que el seguro había dejado de cubrirnos desde el 30 de Septiembre. Los días siguen corriendo y no sabemos cuánto tiempo más necesitará Ericka para estar lo suficientemente fuerte para que le den de alta y finalmente poderla tener en casa con nosotros.Seguimos necesitando de toda la ayuda posible, que sigamos corriendo la voz. Hasta ahora lo hemos hecho impecable, sabemos y tenemos la certeza de que con la ayuda de todos ustedes ¡Lo vamos a lograr! Cada aporte importa y lo hemos podido corroborar.Gracias infinitas por estar allí, los queremos mucho.Let's help Ericka with her hospitalization expensesEricka Perez was 36 weeks pregnant when she got infected with Covid-19. After a pulmonary evaluation,  doctors practiced an emergency cesarean delivery to save her baby, Francesca D'Amico Perez. The baby hasn't met her mom because right after the c-section, Ericka was admitted into the intensive care unit due to the collapse of her right lung. After 8 days of intensive care, Francesca came back home with her dad, Andrea D'Amico. However, Ericka is still in breathing support at the Metropolitan clinic.After 24 days in ICU, Ericka's insurance stopped covering hospitalization expenses, which today reaches over USD 100,000. We need any support to overcome this difficult moment.We want Ericka to get better to meet and join her baby and her husband very soon. Your support, no matter how little it is, will help us to navigate this emergency.Thanks so much for your support! Everything counts, and any amount or action isn't small. We need each of them. Now more than ever, thanksHistoria completa: El 21 de Septiembre, Ericka tenía 36 semanas embarazada de Francesca, la primera hija con su esposo Andrea. Al contraer Covid-19 la ingresaron de emergencia en la Policlínica Metropolitana en Venezuela para estabilizarla, ya que se le dificultaba respirar con facilidad. Sus niveles de oxigenación estaban bajando y fue allí cuándo decidieron practicarle una cesárea preventiva para no afectar a la bebé. El 24 de Septiembre dio a luz a Francesca, sin poder conocerla, ya que desde ese día ambas estuvieron en terapia intensiva.Francesca estuvo hospitalizada durante sus primeros ocho días. Nació con pericarditis (una inflamacion e irritación del tejido que rodea el corazón, el pericardio), con los valores alterados, por los que le pusieron inmunoglobulina (anticuerpos/proteínas de importancia vital que influyen notablemente sobre el equilibrio de nuestro sistema inmunologico). Luego de regular sus valores, Francesca pudo llegar a casa con su papá, su tía y su familia, pero lejos de su madre quien sigue hospitalizada.Ericka nunca conoció a Francesa. Su pulmón izquierdo no volvió a responder y el derecho, a pesar de funcionar ya estaba bastante comprometido. El cuadro se siguió complicando, le dió un neumotórax  (un colapso pulmonar) y tuvieron que intubarla para que la respiración artificial la pudiese mantener estable. En cuestión de horas sufrió un paro cardiaco de casi 3 minutos. Los médicos lograron reanimarla, y volvió a la vida, quedando en un estado estable gracias a una máquina de alto flujo de última generación que le proporciona oxígeno a su cuerpo.El viernes 8 de Octubre le hicieron una traqueostomía para desentubarla ya que el tiempo que llevaba en ese estado superaba lo recomendado, intentando provocar nuevos estímulos que arrojaran nuevos resultados y algunas mejorías.El sábado 9 de Octubre le informaron a Andrea, su esposo y papá de Francesca, que los posibles escenarios son bastante delicados y poco alentadores. Al llevar tantos días hospitalizada, desde el 21 de Septiembre con sus pulmones sin mostrar mejorías y todas las demás complicaciones, existen tres posibles escenarios: 1. Que continúe estable en terapia intensiva gracias a la máquina que la mantiene viva.(Existen solo 3 de estos aparatos en la clínica y no se pueden mover, imposibilitando a Ericka a trasladarse a una habitación privada indefinidamente.)2. Que su estado empeore por otras complicaciones.3. Que mejore progresivamente y salga de ese cuadro con la reacción parcial de sus pulmones esperando las menores secuelas posibles. Este escenario es el milagro que estamos esperando y nos apegamos a que el amor de madre la impulsará a salir adelante para acompañar a esta nueva vida que acaba de crear.Ericka luego de 22 días de dar a luz pudo conocer a su bebé gracias a un permiso especial otorgado por los médicos quienes como nosotros, creen que el contacto con su hija marcará la diferencia.Su seguro de gastos médicos dejó de cubrir los gastos  por la cantidad de días que lleva internada. Si Ericka llega a mejorar y le retiran la oxigenación artificial, pasaría a otro estado clínico, y sin suministros del seguro. Un día en terapia intensiva cuesta USD 1,800 y una cama en la clínica es $800 aproximadamente.Para ser transparentes, no sabemos qué pasará: no hay una proyección ni un panorama claro, no hay un estimado de gastos y no tenemos cómo saber con certeza cuánto más va a durar esto. Todos los días surge un gasto inesperado y este monto que calculamos servirá apenas para pagar menos de dos meses de hospitalización, además, en Venezuela.Actualmente Ericka está estable, mantenida por la máquina, a la espera de que su pulmón pueda reaccionar y hacerla valerse por ella misma. Francesca, su hija recién nacida, quién presentó secuelas del Covid, pericarditis y después de 8 días en terapia intensiva sin conocer a su mamá, pudo por fin el 12 de Octubre acercarse a ella.  Estamos haciendo esta campaña para poder pagar los elevadísimos gastos de hospitalización que ascienden a medida que pasan los días. Hemos usado todos nuestros recursos como familia y ahorros y es por eso que acudimos a ustedes, amigos y amigos de nuestros amigos, para que entre todos logremos reunir este monto, que aunque sabemos que es alto, también sabemos que es posible. Moveremos cielo y tierra para pagar la recuperación de Ericka y que pronto esté junto con su hija, su esposo, y todas las personas que solo pedimos y esperamos su recuperación. No hay NINGÚN aporte pequeño, y si la ayuda económica está fuera de tu alcance, compartir esta campaña con todos tus amigos y conocidos será una contribución más que valiosa para que lleguemos a la meta. Gracias por apoyarnos. Nuestra única meta es superar esta emergencia. Gracias por tu ayuda. No tiene precio. La familia D’Amico Pérez.",46662,100000,13-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-dyess-family-fight-cancer,Help the Dyess Family Fight Cancer,"Philip Carr is organizing this fundraiser. Hi, my name is Philip. I'm fundraising for David Dyess (pronounced dice) and his family. David is married to Denise. They are parents to two boys, Austin, 19, and Aiden, 12. Early in the summer of 2020, David started turning yellow and feeling sick. After going to see a doctor and getting several tests, he was diagnosed with stage two pancreatic cancer. He underwent six aggressive treatments of chemo, and his cancer reacted well to the chemo. Unfortunately, a recent scan showed spots on his liver. When a subsequent liver biopsy came back as cancerous, David’s cancer was re-diagnosed as stage four. He has since had his treatment moved to Columbus, OH, where he has started a new chemotherapy regimen. David and Denise have been involved in church ministry for over twenty-five years. Even while trying to beat his own cancer, David continues his work as a chaplain for Hospice helping those at their end of life and counseling and supporting families who are hurting. He has worked even when he was tired or feeling sick from treatments. David and Denise have dedicated their lives to others and ministry. The medical bills have started to come in. Anyone who has had a major medical diagnosis and treatment knows that, even with insurance, the medical bills can be financially devastating. The money from this fundraiser is needed now. With the latest diagnosis that the cancer had spread to his liver, David may be required to take leave from work or go on disability. This money would not only help them with David's medical expenses and allow them to further pursue various treatments, but it will also supplement their livelihood since David’s is their main source of income. There are three things we are asking everyone to do: 1. Pray for the Dyess Family and that David will beat his cancer diagnosis. 2. Donate something to this GoFundMe. Even if it's a small amount. A lot of small donations can add up! 3. Post and share this GoFundMe to your Social Media accounts. We would love for this to get in front of as many eyes as possible. The Dyess family is in urgent need of support from those of us who can help. After so many years of their helping others, we would love to see an outpouring of help for this family to let them know they are not alone! Thank you for your Prayers, Support, and Sharing this GoFundMe! ",16295,35000,7-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/t7zxa-medical-and-miscellaneous-expenses,Medical and miscellaneous expenses," Hi, our names are Janice Englishlady (grandmother) and Briahna Yuodsnukis (big sister). Ashlynne Sienna Mannes 17 years old. While attending A & M Consolidated High School as a freshman in 2019, Ashlynne was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer, EPITHELIOID SARCOMA. Ashlynne fought very, very hard through chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.  After months of treatment she eventually went into remission. While we were recently able to celebrate one year of remission for Ashlynne, unfortunately she started experiencing migranes.   After an MRI, the Doctor's discovered a spot on her brain, which confirmed that the cancer had returned and metastasized.   Ashlynne spent weeks having more scans and meeting with Doctor's to see how much the cancer had spread.   The Doctor's found additional tumors in Ashlynne's stomach, arm pits, lymph nodes and neck. On October 28, 2021, Ashlynne will have brain surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible.   Once she recovers from brain surgery she will start chemotherapy and radiation for the cancer that has metastasized to the other parts of her body. We know from the first time around, this will be a long and challenging process.  Ashlynne and her mom , Lisa  Mannes, will have to make frequent trips to Temple and Dallas to receive care. Ashlynne  was so incredibly strong and tough during her first fight, we will do everything we can to help her fight this time as well. Any monetary donations will be greatly appreciated.  Please keep Ashlynne and her family in your thoughts and prayers as we go down this very difficult journey.  ",2800,50000,4 days

Ed had just purchased a new bike so he could join his 13 year-old son on the trails. This photo was taken moments before Ed had an accident on his bike, breaking his spine from C2-C4 and T3-T5 locations, damaging his spinal cord and causing paralysis from the chest down. He was on a ventilator in the ICU for 1 month, and due to the paralysis had a lot of trouble breathing. He is lucky to be alive, and just recently moved to a long term, acute care facility in Northern Colorado to begin his long journey of healing, rehabilitation and therapy to learn how to live in his new circumstances. Ed and his family will endure many bills and costs that will not be covered by insurance in the coming months, in addition to numerous home modifications to accommodate Ed's future in a wheelchair.

He was on a commissioned project in the mountains of Fairview, Utah with a poor cell signal, causing a lengthy wait as paramedics searched for him.He required emergency transfer from one hospital to another for his extensive injuries, including a dislocated and broken left shoulder, four broken ribs, and a shattered left foot.Reconstructive surgery on his shoulder and surgery to re-articulate his foot both required permanent implants. After weeks in the hospital recovering, doctors discovered blood clots in both legs and a previously missed fracture in his right tibia, meaning Kenn could no longer stand. During therapy sessions he'd actually been putting all his weight on a broken leg.Thankfully Kenn is home now to heal, but as of October 24th, both legs are still non-weight-bearing and the use of his left arm is at an absolute minimum. He's got a long road of recovery ahead and will be out of work for months.With no access to long- or short-term disability, Kenn is facing mounting out-of-pocket medical expenses as well as rent and cost of living while out of work. He's always been a very giving person and quick to help those in need, especially when it comes to emergency repairs and putting his expansive contractor knowledge to use. Any help given to him during this time is immensely appreciated. ",7712,24000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/randy-severe-medical-fund,Randy Severe Medical Fund," World famous Saddlemaker, Randy Severe, was diagnosed with COVID on Sept 27 and has been in the hospital ever since. Randy is one-of-a-kind. He has a big heart, infectious smile and when you meet him, you feel like you've known him your whole life. Unfortunately, there is not a lot of awareness on the serious effects that COVID leaves behind. The day after Round-Up, Randy wasn't feeling well. He thought if he rested a bit, he'd feel better the next day. The next day came and he was still very tired, out of breath and achy so he continued to lay in bed. He continued to lay in bed for the next 5 days hoping the next day he'd feel better. Randy, who has been extremely healthy his whole life felt that his immune system would be able to fight off the virus just like the common flu. And for many, this is the case. However, for a very select few, COVID can be deadly. COVID attacks the lungs and after 7 days of not seeking help, just laying in bed, his oxygen levels were down to 44%. This was so low, that his body started to shut down. After fighting COVID for 2 weeks in the Pendleton hospital, Randy was life flighted to Portland to continue his care in ICU. He is currently on a ventilator fighting for his life. Randy is trying to recover from the damage that has been done to his lungs. If you know Randy, you'd know he lives a very simple lifestyle. We hope to help Randy and his family with medical expenses, ongoing treatment, and to bring awareness to others.While Randy is hospitalized his son Ryan will be managing the donations on Randy's behalf.

Hello, my name is Lillie, and I'm a dear friend of Gareth Lindwall Honig: a remarkable woman who has been a beloved educator for two decades.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-brandi-battle-cancer,Help Brandi Battle Cancer!," My name is Jennifer and I have one sibling- my younger sister Brandi (36) who is a lovely and intelligent mother of two young boys; Cody (3) and Jack (2). Brandi and her husband Shane live in Australia where they are raising their boys with love, joy and a great appreciation of music. This past March, Brandi received the shocking and devastating diagnosis of stage 3 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is an extremely aggressive, fast moving cancer which is very difficult to treat, especially in such a young woman as Brandi. Although a cancer diagnosis is always hard to swallow, this has been an exceptionally difficult situation as the Covid-19 pandemic has prevented any of my family from being able to be with Brandi to support and help her during this incredibly difficult time. Australia's borders are closed indefinitely, with few exceptions. It has truly been a nightmare for us to not be with her as she fights this awful, invasive disease while she and Shane try to manage young children and their household. Brandi has already gone through chemotherapy and surgery and now has begun radiation.  This is the standard protocol for people diagnosed with TNBC.  There are promising alternative treatments and naturopathic and holistic options but these are all very costly, especially for a young family raising two small children.  Brandi’s treatments and surgeries have required an exhaustive amount of travel and unexpected incurred expenses which has created additional stress in an already stressful situation.  Helping to ease some of that burden would allow Brandi to focus on healing and give her access to treatments that can better her outcomes.  Any amount you are able to contribute to Brandi's fight is important and much appreciated! If you are not able to contribute, your sharing of this story along with sending good thoughts, vibes and prayers her way is equally appreciated! Cody and Jack need to grow up *with* their mom and know how hard she fought for them! Your help could give them that opportunity.  Thank you all for your support and for taking the time to learn about Brandi's battle. We are forever grateful! ",8205,25000,4 days

Cassi recently underwent a double mastectomy. And her healing process has been hindered along the way. The most recent hospital stay following her surgery was two weeks, leaving her husband to miss work for her various procedures and to care for their three beautiful children, alone. The emotion this has evoked in this family has bonded them even moreso than before. But the toll has been great. One of their lovely children has fallen ill during the course of Cassi's recovery and additional/pending treatments, further complicating an already delicate situation. Not only do unplanned days off from work put employment at risk during an already emotional period of time, but also the financial strain that results is immense and takes its own toll. Our goal is conservative right now, though it is urgent -- a little help, a hand in these difficult times. And I will keep you updated as I am able. If you know this family and are local to them, consider meal donations (whole-egg allergy), as well. This is a family of five when mom and the one kiddo are not in their respective hospitals.

Due to Covid protocols in place at the hospital, Bill has not been able to see or stay with either of them despite also fighting to recover from Covid and being concerned about his family.  Unfortunately, Maude's condition continued to worsen. Maude passed away on the morning of Wednesday, October 6th. Bill is continuing to try to recover while grieving the loss of Maude and being deeply worried about Austin. Since Bill and Maude were self-employed and did not have insurance, the medical bills are a great concern. The restaurant has been closed for the past three weeks and the reopen is undetermined.

Gary has written a message explaining what he has been going through and what his treatment will consist of. ""Several months ago I began to have trouble swallowing solid food, so I went to the doctor and they ordered some tests. Fast forward several weeks, and after all the scans, scopes, and bloodletting, it has been confirmed. I am officially on medical leave from the salon, and will be starting chemo and radiation treatments on November the second. Once the tumor has shrunk, the plan is to have surgery. Ugh. Those of you who know me, know that I don't often post personal info, but this time around I thought it best to share with you what’s going on. My pain is, for now, being well-managed. My energy level is pretty low, but I'm working on it. Because of that, I'm asking for you to hold off on calling or texting me. My throat gets tired quickly if I talk too much, and as much as I love all my friends, I would prefer to be able to choose the timing of communication. If you want to reach out, it would be much better to message me on FB, or email me. It will brighten my day to hear from friends. I've lost 25 pounds as a result of this. I'm not complaining, I'm bragging! Ha! On that note, if anyone is thinking of dropping food by the house, know that I am on a liquid-only diet, which does NOT include alcohol (Dammit!) As much as I love a good surprise, when it comes to food, it’s best if I’m in-the-know. I'm not sure how long this fight will go on, as it is impossible to predict. I have planned for 4 months of leave, but may need to extend that. We shall see. As scary and awful as all of this is, please know that I plan to fight this tooth and nail.

He's still getting chemo treatments.Tom has Stage IV Metastatic Colo-Rectal Cancer. This cancer is chronic and he will need to be on maintenance chemo until a cure is found.  He is currently fighting a spread into his small bowels. This will last six months. At the end, his cancer will hopefully have shrunk enough to reverse his ileostomy surgery and reconnect his colon. Then, he will have six to eight weeks recovery time as his digestive system returns to normal.  Tom is an artist who worked his whole life bringing joy to others with his music and editing great films. Unfortunately, these things don't allow for any help regarding health care and keeping a roof over your head in times of need. Let's give back to a beautiful man who has given so much.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jennifer-and-sebastian-heal-from-lyme,Help Jennifer and Sebastian Heal from Lyme," Dearest loved ones and beautiful friends, whether you are someone we know personally or someone who is here because you believe in my work and want to support my wellbeing because of it, thank you so much for taking the time to visit and read these words today. It means more than I can possibly say. Sebastian and I have been on a long-term journey treating Lyme Disease and associated health issues and your help would make all the difference in the world, and allow us to continue treatment at a time when we would otherwise not be able to. Even a small offering means so much, and I’m glad to say it just takes two minutes to complete a donation. A childhood tick bite helped set the trajectory for my life in ways I could never have imagined. Lyme has brought powerful gifts to my life, and to both of our lives, but also immense pain, and we are asking for your help so that we can continue treatment and restore the wellbeing we so dearly wish for and deserve. While my intuitive and healing gifts have been tremendously golden, crucial, and even our most powerful assistance on this journey, sometimes you also need to open up and ask for help. Please feel free to read our longer story below if you are interested, and to see our “give back” to donors as well! Thank you so much with all of our hearts for taking a moment to make a donation now if you feel called! We are also grateful for any help you can give to even simply share this link on your social media pages. I appreciate each of you for taking the time to read our story. We will be holding you in our hearts with gratitude so deeply! You can also send a check if you prefer to: Jennifer Posada P.O. Box 1715 Eastsound, WA 98245 The Longer Story… When I was a little girl I used to visit my grandmother in the tobacco fields of Southern Virginia, and I would come home every time with tick bites, one of which would change the course of the rest of my life. I am forever grateful to Lyme Disease for the teachings it has given me, and the way it has shaped my path, even though it has been more harrowing at times over the years than I could ever express in words. I still wouldn’t be the person I am today without this experience. Sebastian also feels exactly the same way. It can be hard to summarize a long health journey, especially with an “invisible” illness, and it can also be incredibly hard to ask for help. But it is my heart’s deep hope that in doing so, I model that asking for help can be immensely brave and wise. We are meant to be interdependent, and when life brings us to our knees, reaching out is one of the most courageous and powerful things we could ever do. I tend to try not to overfocus on Lyme as the only cause of my illness because most illnesses are multifactoral, and because for both Sebastian and I, we may now be attempting more to repair the damage than treating an active Lyme infection. Unfortunately, chronic Lyme treatment tends to be a multi-year journey that is very specific to each person depending on what their system’s other weaknesses are that need healing in order for the body to thrive again. Sebastian and I have come such a very long way on our healing journey and are grateful for our progress every day. It is also incredibly true that without our continuing treatment we would still face a level of debilitation and dysfunction that would be profound, and unfortunately treatment is expensive and that’s why we are asking for help. Any amount you offer would be appreciated and honored beyond words. Thank you so much for your time, your love, and your support. It is life changing. May you be blessed infinitely on your own path for this gift, and may it come back to you many, many times over. Love, Jennifer and Sebastian The Big Dreams… This goal amount gives us a good footing moving forward with our treatment, (though any amount will be so appreciated!) It will help us with our supplements, foods as medicine, and other various treatments as well as any repeat lab tests or doctor’s fees. Truth be told, it would help us greatly to raise more than this goal amount so we could feel sure we could treat however many years this may require, or move in whatever direction our treatment needs to take. Beyond that, as it’s a powerful thing to say out loud or put into writing your biggest dreams, ours is to own at least several acres of land with a home on it on the island where we live in order to create a most nourishing and healing environment for ourselves as we move toward fully restored wellness, and where I can write my next books. I’m just putting this out there as a little message to the universe while we have our hands and hearts so open to support and love... The Give Back… Below are some gifts to thank our donors, and I will continue to share the wisdom this journey has brought me for years to come, helping in all ways I can to promote healing for others. More and more of the world is facing issues of illness and chronic illness, and being able to maintain a spiritual connection and feeling of meaning can be not only powerfully healing but even lifesaving. Below you will find a link to some very special pieces I have written about my health journey from a spiritual and deeply embodied perspective, and I hope they bring great revelation and great comfort to you or any loved ones you have that may be suffering. Also, I am offering my pay-what-you-want Essential Self-Love Course to anyone who donates! See the details at the link below... Spirituality and Illness Series & Self-Love Course... Thank you again so very much for your support with absolutely all of our hearts! ",4055,36000,21-Oct-21

In a matter of hours, life went from manageable circumstances to absolute devastation. On top of that, Danny suffered a health crisis this summer & has been hit hard with 75K in hospital bills. D-o-g is in treatment now, which will run him another 4K.  Let's help Danny & D-O-G get back on their feet while recovering from this series of (more than unfortunate) events. If you know Danny, you know he is pure of heart and a joy to be around. Growing up, he was a staple in my community & continues to be a friend who always offers a helping hand or good company when needed. Please know that this fundraising goal is a bare minimum for what Danny needs help with, but that every little bit counts & helps to ease the burden of keeping up with the cost of living while recovering from these intense events.

This was not an easy decision by any means, but, we are so grateful that people just want to help!  Please continue to pray for us as a family, for Clara's continued recovery, and that we will be able to come home very soon.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/sierras-rare-disease,Sierra's Rare Disease," NMDAR Autoimmune Encephalitis  Hello, my name is Stephanie, and I'm the mother to a beautiful 18 year old daughter, Sierra. Beginning in early September 2021, she was out with friends when she had a grand mal seizure. Her health was always in great condition, so this was a complete shock. After being discharged from the hospital,  she came home to only have different types of seizures. She would stare off into space & speak jibberish. One day it happened and I just called 911. After a 5 day stay in the hospital, they couldn't figure it out, so they sent her home on Keppra, which is a popularly used and newer type of seizure medicine. Once home, she started to act strange. She just wasn't the same Sierra as before. She would confuse reality and fantasy, and speak really fast and not make any sense at all. Her emotions were all over the place and switched up so fast. In hindsight, I now know that this is the beginning stages of symptoms that happen with her very rare disease called NMDAR autoimmune encephalitis. She couldn't figure out what was going on with her and she couldn't pinpoint what exactly was happening; so she went back to the hospital to see if maybe they'd switch her medicine to a different seizure medicine. At the hospital, her behavior was a little outrageous. Speaking to everyone as though she knew them her whole life, telling everyone these outrageous things. She then got into a funk and her mood changed so fast. After talking with nurses and a therapist on sight at the ER, Sierra decided whatever would help ""fix her brain"", then that's what she was willing to do. So she signed herself into the Psych ward. She's 18. She had no idea what that entailed, or what would or could happen. Sierra was in for a 72hr hold. After things progressively got worse, the therapist thought it was best Sierra no longer make decisions on her own. When I would ask what exactly is she being treated for, he could only say he doesn't know exactly what's going on, but he was treating her for what they called mania. Still she rapidly declined. She became very out of it, had catatonic behavior, and wouldn't respond to any medicines (they tried many). It was also at this time that she completely quit calling home. She would never do that while not being with her child. Not on her own she wouldn't. That helped me see the severity of what was happening. Eventually, she also became self-injurous. This is very scary because you know they have absolutely no control over what their brain is telling them to do. While in that state, she felt no pain. Please forgive me for not wanting to say what all happened at that time. I would hate for her to know I spoke of her most vulnerable moments without her approval. The therapist asked to do a lumbar puncture. That's when neurology saw and diagnosed her with the NMDA autoimmune encephalitis. Basically what this disease does is; your immune system assumes your brain is foreign matter, and attacks it. (Think of our immune system with a cold). Her health even then continued to rapidly declinewith what the doctors called an ""aggressive case"" of the disease. She went to ICU and was put on life support. They had to insert a ventilator to help her breathe, insert a pick line, and also put a catheter in her neck in order to start a treatment called plasmapheresis. So far, she has had; 2 MRI's, 2 CT scans, 1 lumbar puncture, an intra- vaginal ultrasound, an ultrasound of her lungs (since the ventilator caused a terrible case of pneumonia), steroids, 5 plasmapheresis treatments, and 1 dose of Rituximab. The next dose is coming up in November. This disease ""typically"" affects younger women and is caused by a mass (or I was told a teratoma) in the ovaries. After all the procedures didn't detect any mass at all, we are kind of stuck with no answers. Even the neurologist and doctors tell us ""We just don't know because it's so rare"". To not have answers, is the hardest part of all. Sierra was working, bought her own car, and graduated high school, all while pregnant with her now 1 year old. She's very bright, very bubbly, funny as ever, and so much fun to be around. Seeing this disease completely change her is just heart wrenching. I'm asking for help with a few things. My number one reason being, when she's able to come home, I will need special provisions to equip her room medically. I'm not sure if I'll need to hire medical help or not, but I can only imagine so because her doctor said she would need help with everyday living (bathing, restroom, grooming, etc.). I also need help providing for her 1 year old daughter who is now in my care. Not only am I taking care of my grand daughter Kaylani, but I also have 3 other small children. Sierra's siblings are 5, 11, and 12. The holidays are creeping up really fast . I will probably need help providing for and celebrating Christmas and Thanksgiving as well. I am currently on an unpaid leave of absence from work. I do not want her to get better and not have someone there with her. So I want to be the first one there at all times.  I am not sure what else to expect because as of now, doctors aren't sure if she is going to be able to walk, talk, eat, write, or how disrupted her brain is yet. I will continue to update often. #NMDAR #autoimmune #encephalitis #goodmom # ",830,5000,2 days

Recently, on October 24, 2021, we lost our main character and most amazing husband and father, Tim Taylor. This time has been so very difficult on our family, but together, each has been a pilar of love and strength for each other. If you knew Tim, you knew his joy came from making other people feel loved and happy. You knew his family was his everything and he loved all of us very much. And you also knew and loved him for his never wavering and wild sense of humor…he could make anyone and everyone laugh.  My mom, Karen Taylor has been working so very hard to financially support their household while Tim was ill and could not work, and although we knew this day would come, it came much sooner than expected and has left my Mom in financially difficult times. After life costs, house payments, bills, medical bills, past debts and so on, do not allow time to grieve and take time off work. Unfortunately our system isn’t set up for that support for grieving spouses or family members. My mom is a tough woman, she pushes through and is resilient, but this is different. We have never created a go-fund-me, but my family and parents have always given back. They are the type of souls that would give their last everything to you if you needed it, and have done so with many of their friends and family. My hope is that my mom and family could have a little help during this time. Thank you to all who have reached out. We love you all very much. ",2175,3000,4 days

Hi, my name is JoAnn LoBello-Ruf and I am Peter’s sister. Peter had a massive stroke at home on August 29, 2021. His wife, Angela called 911 and Peter was taken to the ER where he assessed, intubated and admitted to ICU. He was taken off life support and was able to breath on his own. Unfortunately, that’s about all he was able to do. Peter is paralyzed on his right side, has aphasia which is the inability to speak. He has also been diagnosed with vascular dementia. Peter is awake, but is unable to follow commands or communicate in any fashion. Therefore he is unable to demonstrate any understanding of his current medical condition. At this time Peter is incapable of making any medical, financial or legal decisions. Angela is his legal guardian and his rock. Peter’s road to recovery is a very long one. We have been told he may not recover, but we believe in the power of prayer and miracles. Right now he is in acute rehab where he’s getting 24 hour care. Unfortunately insurance will not continue to pay for this. Our main and only goal is to get Peter the very best care. Any and all funds collected will be used only for Peter’s medical and legal bills. Thank you for taking the time to read this; thank you for any help you can give, no amount is too small. Please share this page with your friends. JoAnn ",10826,25000,12-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/paisleys-open-heart-surgery-fundraiser,Paisleys Open Heart Surgery Fundraiser, Paisley is 2 1/2 years old and needs open heart surgery. She has both lung and heart issues. She was first diagnosed with Broncho Malacia then Scimitar Syndrome. Her left airway is not constructed normally and both her airways are weak. Her right lung is smaller then her left. This will require daily life long lung therapy. Then when doing a MRI the doctors found that the Scimitar vein is draining her entire right lung improperly to the left side of her heart along with finding a double shunt that is taking oxygenated blood from her left lung and directing some of it also back to the lungs and not to the rest of her body. So she is not getting even one whole lung worth of oxygenated blood to the rest of her body. This will require her to get a catherization done first to see how to fix it all. Then Open Heart Surgery in the coming months. This will all be done at CHOP in Philly. We know there will be out of pocket expenses to pay for but we never thought we would ever need. Any support for Paisley is Greatly Appreciated!! ,5411,7000,22-Oct-21

For the past five years, Kelli McLaughlin has devoted much of her time and energy to serving and supporting the needs of those in her community and across the world. Kelli created Clothes With A Cause with a mission to raise money for vulnerable people. After purchasing beautiful clothing, home goods, and accessories from the CWAC boutique, Kelli donates 100% of the proceeds to support children Cleft Lip/Palate, US veterans, those with Down syndrome, people in need of clean water, etc. Kelli has fought tirelessly to support the needs of others, and now the time has come to join Kelli’s fight to beat cancer.  Kelli was recently diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor (High Grade Glioma). In September, she began experiencing numbness on the left side of her body, and after the necessary testing, a quarter-sized tumor was discovered. After just a few short weeks, Kelli’s episodes of numbness turned into more significant seizures. More scans were completed thereafter, and Kelli’s neurosurgeon determined that the tumor had grown, and surgery was recommended. On October 4, 2021, Kelli underwent surgery, and doctors believe that 100% of the tumor was removed! Due to the aggressive nature of this type of cancer, Kelli’s oncologists are recommending both radiation and chemotherapy to both treat the High Grade Glioma and prevent any reoccurrence. Kelli’s surgery and these subsequent treatments have already taken and will continue to take a toll on Kelli and her sweet family. With that said, Kelli is optimistic and ready to give her all to beat cancer! Like most people, Kelli and her incredible husband, Ryan, are much more comfortable helping others. They’ve loved donating the proceeds from CWAC these past five years. And while they would be the first people to line up to help anyone else on this journey, we know they are surrounded by people who love them and want to support them as Kelli overcomes cancer. They are receiving messages daily from friends and family, asking what they need and how they can help. This is your opportunity to join the fight to help Kelli beat cancer! All donations will be used to pay for medical expenses and needs that arise as Kelli moves through this journey. And it will come as no surprise to you that any donations that extend beyond their needs will be paid forward to support the needs of another family going through this same battle with cancer. Every donation is appreciated, and every dollar with be handled with care. Kelli, Ryan, and the rest of the family appreciate your thoughts, prayers, good vibes, and support!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/sweet-riley-lynn,Sweet Riley Lynn,"Heather Kimble is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Christopher Trieschman. Hi, my name is Heather and one of my very best friends, her husband and their sweet baby girl need your help. Nicki and Chris welcomed their beautiful, healthy baby girl into this world on July 16, 2021, sharing her birthday with her mama. It was the most special birthday gift for Nicki. The first two months of Riley's life were picture perfect, until one day everything changed. About 5 weeks ago Nicki noticed a small lump on Riley’s head and a few small purple lesions all over her back. After taking her to the pediatrician twice to figure out what it was Nicki was finally rushed in with a dermatologist who did a skin biopsy. Those results came back showing abnormal cells, to which they were referred to the John’s Hopkins pediatric oncology team and their pathologist completed further testing of that skin biopsy leading them to the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Riley then had to have a bone marrow biopsy to see if she had leukemia as myeloid sarcoma is typically linked with leukemia. Her initial results all came back not showing any traces of cancer cells so Nicki and Chris thought Riley was in the clear. However their happy news quickly turned into words that no parent ever wants to hear, their sweet 3 month old baby girl has acute myeloid leukemia. Riley was admitted to the pediatric oncology unit at Hopkins yesterday (10/13/21) and had a central line placed today (10/14/21) as well as another bone marrow biopsy done. She will start her first round of chemo within the next few days. Her treatment will either consist of 4-5 rounds of chemo or 3 rounds of chemo and a bone marrow transplant. Each round of chemo will be about a week and she will need to remain in the hospital for 3-4 weeks following each round of chemo to monitor her closely. No parent can prepare for the news that Nicki and Chris have received and the journey their lives have now brought them to face. As Nicki and Chris will be spending most of their time at the hospital with Riley, this Go Fund Me will hopefully help eliminate some of the financial burden that comes their way. Nicki and Chris deserve to be able to focus solely on their baby girl's health, treatment and recovery. All donations are appreciated. ",26372,15000,14-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/madelines-battle-against-glioblastoma,Madeline’s Battle Against Glioblastoma Cancer,"Dean Gay is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Robert Dombroski. I am proud to say that I have known Madeline Dombroski for 22 years. I met Madeline's son Bobby sophomore year of high school and we became fast friends. We are best friends to this day and I consider Bobby and his mom family. I sincerely hope to know Madeline for many more years, but devastatingly to myself, her friends, and loved ones, that will not be possible. Life tends to blindside us when we least expect it and sadly misfortune befalls even the greatest of us. Madeline recently retired and moved to Maine in August of this year to be with Bobby, his wife Larkin, and her grandchild Alma. She was looking forward to a fresh start and to enjoy her retirement with her closest loved ones, especially with Alma who she absolutely adores, as you can see from the cover photo! For Madeline, misfortune fell at a time that could not be more inopportune when she was diagnosed with terminal Glioblastoma brain cancer within weeks of moving to Maine. Before she left she was having nagging issues with her wrist that was suspected to be related to her previous carpal tunnel diagnosis. But sadly those issues could not be related to any worse circumstance. The Dombroskis are hardworking self-sufficient people who are too humble to ask for help even when they need it the most. So I am spearheading this initiative at my suggestion with their support, approval, and graciousness. Everyone was hoping Madeline would have a fighting chance to beat the cancer, and until two days past this Gofundme was going to be about helping her fight the good fight. Then her outlook in facing this aggressive, evil disease changed rapidly when she was informed the only helpful treatment would be to receive hospice care so she can have the least painful end of life. As unjust as it sounds for such a selfless woman, much of the necessary palliative treatment is not being covered by Medicare. This is Madeline's story. To all those who've had the pleasure of meeting her, Madeline is a kind, thoughtful and giving person to say the least. She grew up in Southwest Philadelphia as one of four children, whose mom was one of eighteen children. Madeline married Robert Dombroski and they had their one and only child Bobby. The Dombroskis are not strangers to adversity. When Bobby was a young child tragedy struck when his father died and Madeline became widowed. Another way to describe Madeline is a strong Italian Catholic woman that speaks her mind. Thus it was no surprise that when she was widowed it did not stop her from facing life head on. Madeline continued to work tirelessly at the travel agency where she would ultimately spend over 30 years. She did not remarry and she devoted herself to providing the best upbringing that she could for Bobby. By no means did she become wealthy. But she worked hard and selflessly so she could send Bobby to one of the most well-regarded private schools in the Philadelphia region so he could have best education she could afford. To offer a personal perspective on Madeline, I remember meeting her as a 15 year old kid from the suburbs with a not-so-great home situation. I can't say I'd ever met anyone quite like her in the way that she is strong and selfless. Madeline was always open and kind to me and I would spend countless nights over her house without any objection. She has spent her whole life thinking of others and now she needs people to think about her. We are asking for any kind generosity that those who are willing to give, will give. The following are the mounting costs for Madeline and her family that they most direly need help with: 1. Childcare for Alma costing $20 an hour so Bobby and his wife Larkin can focus on tending to and spending the time that remains with his mom. 2. House cleaning costing $25 an hour related to the same circumstance above. 3. Round-the-clock registered nurse care costing $30 an hour. 4. Healthy meals for Madeline costing approximately $10 per meal. 5. Medication cost of $600 per month. 6. KN95 masks for all visitors due to Madeline's compromised fragile immune system, costing $20-$30 per box. 7. Sterilized gloves costing $20 per box. 8. The unknown cost of her hospital recent stays and brain surgery, the bills of which they have yet to receive, but are expected to be insurmountable.  The Dombroskis sincerely appreciate any generosity kindly given to help Madeline. Thank you! ",15290,25000,15-Oct-21

I was waiting until we had a clear diagnosis, but everything about this situation has been difficult and time may be running out. Timm has been a part of the restaurant world for quite a while, which means he does not have health insurance. He had been feeling ill for a few months, and couldn't shake it. He tested negative for COVID and when he still wasn't improving, he went to the ER, where we found out that his hemoglobin was so low, they don't know how he was still alive. After many tests, a surgery and a couple of labs that couldn't figure out what was going on, we knew it was cancer, just not which kind. He has been in and out of the ER 3 times since the initial visit (4 weeks ago), had blood transfusions and they know he has a mass in his stomach which is preventing him from eating, but we are waiting to see how they handle that. They finally gave a diagnosis of Melanoma, but we do not what stage, yet. He went to the ER yesterday (10/25/2021) in extreme pain and was admitted to the hospital last night. During that time, his cancer doctor's office called to say they could start chemo, but they cannot do that until he is out of the hospital. He has been out of work for over a month and could use financial help. He was approved for cancer treatment, but that will not cover his multiple ER visits or his personal expenses, such as rent, etc. I am grateful to everyone that has reached out to check on him and I know he is, as well. Any donations would be appreciated and if you are unable to donate, please spread the word. My family and I thank you. ",1775,5000,4 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-roy-fight-esophageal-cancer,Please Help Roy Fight Esophageal Cancer,"Mellie Becho is organizing this fundraiser. Dear Family and Friends, As most of you know we have been living and renting out an apartment in Houston by MD Anderson since Roy was diagnosed in late April with Stage 4a Esophageal Cancer. This path has been so very hard, torturous, in fact. We’ve been on a cruel roller coaster ride, rising up to the most optimistic heights, and then being cast down to the most despairing depths. We are committed to fight right alongside him every step of the way. He's been in the hospital for over a month now but this is what families do. We stay together and fight together. Today, I humbly come to you to answer the many of you that have come forward to see how you can assist us with medical bills and treatment. We are eternally grateful and humbled to those that have come forward and helped out already. Roy loves many of the Beatles lyrics, singing them often, and loud, but one sticks out to us, and he’d repeated it many times. It forms much of what he believes about relationships. He believes that by spreading love and kindness, you can create a more loving world. If you’re lucky, that love will come back to you.  The words, which summarize this life view, are “And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.”  Roy has created a lot of love in his life, from his positive outlook, his one liners, his love of our family, his huge smile, his passions, his music, his insights, his sweetness, and, of course, his humor and goofiness with those whom he cares deeply about. And now, that love is coming back to him, to support him through this difficult time. We are eternally grateful and humbled to those that have come forward and donated to us already. If you can, please consider helping us out with any amount that you can. While we know it's tough for many of us, if you cannot help please send prayers instead. It is the unfaltering love and support of family and friends which has sustained us through these trials. Please keep the prayers and positive vibes as we need them more than ever. We love you all and remember GOD will pay you back threefold. PLEASE SHARE!! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, The Roy Becho Family ",14713,20000,14-Oct-21

Carson is a son, grandson, nephew, cousin, and friend to so many and so we wanted to offer another way that all of his loved ones can send their support to him and his family. This journey has had ups and downs, but we all remain hopeful that Carson can beat this disease and heal. He has a very long road ahead of him, and so this fundraiser will help Carson and his parents with upcoming expenses, both in and out of the hospital. Thank you so much! A message from his parents, Mike and Jana: Our names are Mike and Jana Leeney and we are Carson’s parents. It has been a very tough roller-coaster. Forward steps, backward steps. But forward baby steps are awesome!! The best thing is that all of Carson’s organs are good, except his lungs.  His mom is able to visit daily and dad is able to visit when he is in Denver. Our visits are allowed only 15 min a day, but we have been there 45 min. We just stay out of the way. We are not allowed in the room, but we see him through a glass wall and glass door. He is able to hear us though. As parents there are no words to describe seeing your child laying in the hospital and not being able to touch him. Run your fingers through his hair, kiss his cheek, pat his arm, etc. When we visit, we talk in a “normal” conversation. We tell him stories from family and from his friends. We tell him jokes and laugh. We tell him we are proud of him for fighting so hard.  We tell him there are 1000’s of people praying. We remind him God and his Angels are with him and he is being healed, but he has to do his part. Fight and rest. Carson, you are a Warrior! Carson Strong!!  We Love You!!! We want to say thank you for your support for our son, Carson. His road ahead is months long. We will give updates when we can. ",4681,50000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/Help-baby-emmett,Help Baby Emmett and his parents through Chemo,"Team fundraiserMikiaelea Lewis and Elisa Folsom are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Alyssa Saia. Baby Emmett is 6 months old and he is a warrior! He may be tiny (with the chunkiest of baby thighs) but he is mighty. Though he is strong and continues to brighten our days with his smile, Emmett and his parents could use any and all the support that you have to offer.Alyssa will need to take an unpaid leave of absence from her 1st grade classroom to be at the hospital with Emmett full time. Dan will be commuting to and from Boston to continue to teach his kindergarteners and 1st graders during the day and also be able to spend evenings and nights with Alyssa and baby Emmett. In addition to hospital bills, household bills, gas, food costs, etc. will start to pile up. If we can relieve just a little bit of stress due to this financial burden, they will be able to redistribute that energy into caring for and supporting Emmett through the extremely difficult treatment he has to endure. Please continue to check back here for updates on Emmett’s journey. In an effort to relieve some of the stress of responding to countless messages and phone calls looking for updates, I will try to keep an up to date account of what is going on with Emmett and his treatment, here on this page. We cannot express how much your love and support means to Emmett, Dan and Alyssa as well as the rest of the family! Emmett is such a lucky boy to have so many people who love him so much. We honestly and graciously appreciate your generosity during this scary and uncertain time.  From Alyssa, Mommy of baby Emmett: On Friday, August 20, Dan and I took our beautiful baby boy to see a pediatric ophthalmologist, who was referred to us by our PCP Dr. Danielson, for what we believed was a routine eye appointment.  We had seen our pediatrician earlier in the week and she had suggested we have Baby Emmett’s eyes checked.  Emmett, seemed to have one lazy eye.  We were not worried, as the condition is not uncommon in babies his age and can be easily treated with an eye patch or glasses.  Besides, he is adorable!We never expected that appointment to turn our worlds upside down.  We are forever grateful to Dr. Wong for immediately recognizing that Baby Emmett had excess fluid and swelling in his brain that was pressing on the optic nerve of his eye.  The worst words I have ever heard in my life “put your baby in the car and drive straight to Boston Children’s Hospital.”  It was the longest drive of our lives.After what seemed like hours of tests, we were given news NO parent should ever hear; Baby Emmett has a tumor branching to different parts of the cerebellum.  One of the tumors was preventing the cerebrospinal fluid from draining normally, thus causing the swelling and excess fluid.  Baby Emmett was admitted to the ICU.  On Monday, August 23, the Neurosurgeons from Boston Children’s Hospital wheeled my baby out of the ICU.  Dan and I watched in disbelief and despair with the realization that they were going to operate on our sweet baby boy’s brain.  We had been briefed on the many risks associated with the surgery. To say the least, it was the longest day of our lives.  When the surgeons returned, we gathered in the conference room.  We listened as they told us they were able to remove 80 – 85% of the large tumor blocking the drain from the brain to the spinal cord.  There were so many risks associated with this surgery, but the doctors told us Emmett handled the surgery like a Rockstar!  He is our mighty little warrior.Then we waited.  We waited for Baby Emmett to wake up, we waited for Baby Emmett to smile, we waited for Baby Emmett to be Emmett again; and we waited for the pathology results.  It seemed like an eternity.On Friday August 27, we received the pathology results; Baby Emmett has Cancer.  His specific diagnosis is Desmoplastic Nodular Medulloblastoma (DNMB).Desmoplastic Nodular Medulloblastoma (DNMB) is an aggressive brain tumor for which there is no standard treatment.  This type of brain tumor tends to grow quickly and spread into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (the Cerebrospinal fluid.)  The usual treatment for this condition includes high doses of radiation therapy given to the brain and spine to prevent the tumor from spreading.Because of the known risks of permanent damage to thinking, learning and growing in patients Baby Emmett’s age, the oncology team has recommended a Chemotherapy regimen used in a series of clinical trials called the “Head Start Trials.”  Dan and I have been residing in Baby Emmett’s Hospital room. The oncology team expects we will be here for another seven (7) months.    I have made the difficult decision to take an unpaid leave of absence from my full-time teaching job so that I can be here with Baby Emmett throughout his treatment.  Dan will be returning to work next week and will be commuting back and forth from Boston daily.  The next seven months are going to be difficult.  We are keeping our eye on the goal of GETTING EMMETT HOME.We have had so many people reach out with their love and support.  Dan and I cannot express enough how truly grateful we are for all of the kind words and offers of support from our friends and family.  We are genuinely moved by all of the kindness.

Over two years ago at age 9, my little brother Kian, developed a rare cancer, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in his right hip. Now, his cancer has returned with a vengeance and has multiplied throughout his lungs. He was diagnosed to have reached stage 4. We're now forced to act fast, as his treatment options are few and his time is running out.My family and I have been searching for whatever it takes to get him the help he needs. In our quest to save his life, we read about DeltaRex-G, a genetic medicine that has cured patients with bone cancer and pancreatic cancer. We found out that it is available at the Sarcoma Oncology Center and the Aveni Foundation in Santa Monica CA, and he has started treatment with DeltaRex-G. However, the drug supply is very limited and Kian can only receive 2 weeks of therapy with DeltaRex-G. We are optimistic that if Kian can continue to be treated with this medicine, he has a chance of winning his battle against cancer.The challenge we face is the high cost of drug manufacturing. Through gofundme.com, we would like to support the Aveni Foundation to raise the $500,000 needed to make the drug. This funding will help open the door for helping numerous other cancer patients. This funding will be distributed to the Aveni Foundation. The drug is manufactured through the auspices of the Aveni Foundation, a non-profit organization. It will produce a large batch of the drug that will be given to many other cancer victims, beyond Kian. The cost will cover the manufacturing, lot release testing (to test it for safety and potency), storing the drug, shipping, and stability studies in compliance with FDA regulations.The Sarcoma Oncology center focuses on the treatment of rare cancers, and although it has already been FDA approved, most other pharmaceutical companies care to invest in more common cancer types.  We pray that you will help us raise the funds needed. This is an urgent matter; the sooner they get the funding, the bigger our chance to save his life.Please help us save Kian and in doing so, saving numerous other cancer victims.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-give-emily-the-gift-of-treasured-time,Help Give Emily The Gift Of Treasured Time," Hi everyone, this is Kerissa Feuerstein and I’m a very close friend of Emily, her husband Ray, and their children (Raymond, Megan, and Jacob). As some of you may know Emily was diagnosed with cervical cancer in September of last year. At that time we kept this information to her family and a handful of close friends as we all didn’t want to alarm those who know and love Emily. This was a difficult choice to her and her family as they chose to navigate this journey without the support of many of you. At the time of her diagnosis they were hoping that managing the news was helping them to control what seemed like an uncontrollable situation. Soon after diagnosing her cancer they started treatments involving radiation and chemotherapy. As time progressed we stayed hopeful that Emily would beat her cancer and we would soon be celebrating together. When January came, Emily had been given the news that things were looking as though they should and the docs were feeling confident that in 2 more months when she would have a pet scan the results would be good and Emily will get to ring the Bell to say F you to cancer!! Quickly March came and the PET scan was done but we didn’t get the news that we had hoped for. The cancer had spread to two places in her stomach and a third place in a lymph node between her neck and shoulder. We took this news as just one more challenge and Emily became determined to remain fearless and continue on her path to being cancer free.  On April 6, Ray and Emily chose to fully commit their love to one another and join their families as one becoming husband and wife. Emily, her son Jacob, Ray, his son Raymond and daughter Megan all grew in their love for another that day. I was so grateful to see some happiness begin to shine through on their family after the months of devastating news. This family made their support system even stronger for the months ahead. After a couple more months of treatments, Emily was finally given news in June that her cancer was shrinking! This was news we had been waiting to hear after many tears, minor surgeries, countless visits to the hospital and many days that her side effects were less than desirable. At this point treatments were adjusted and Emily pushed forward. We stayed hopeful that we would soon be telling everyone it was time to celebrate. Unfortunately, only 3 months later this is not the case. The last month and a half has been nothing but heartache and disappointment for Emily and her family. From being hospitalized, placed on palliative care, and now hospice. The doctors telling us that Emily only has several weeks to maybe 2 months until end of life. Last night we welcomed Emily home where she is finally back where she belongs… in her home she has built with her loving husband Ray and her sweet son Jacob. With a heavy heart and many tears, I’m asking you all to help give Emily and her family the most precious gift of time by allowing her husband Ray to stay home. While Emily has spent this last year fighting for her life, Ray has continued to juggle both his time with her and his need to work at the VA. With Emily on hospice, her family needs to be at her side while they navigate through these difficult moments in their lives. As we all know, no work = no money, fighting cancer = endless medical bills, being sick = you are still a parent, and with Jacob still at home he also needs this support. I ask for you to help Emily care for him as his mother and as she continues this fight with cancer. This is a time no one should have to go through and if they do, they should be able to do so with all of their attention and time dedicated to the ones they love!Thank you in advance for any donations we will and already have received.  This means the world to me and Emily’s family during this time! We wish for you and your family to always be together and healthy. If terminal illness ever touches your lives, which we hope it never does, we wish that people far and wide will become your angels as so many have for Emily’s family. ❤️ WE LOVE YOU EMILY, RAY, MEGAN, RAYMOND AND JACOB ❤️ ",13255,25000,6 days

If you looked at her, you wouldn’t know that our mom has had Multiple Myeloma for the last five years. When she told us about her diagnosis four years ago, it was scary. It felt as if she was telling us that she was going to die tomorrow. But what we learned over time was that her “progression” (the rate at which her cancer was growing) was pretty slow. It still made her tired, and feel pretty crappy, but we stopped worrying that she was going to die at any moment. We got back to living… we watched her make dinner every night, keep the house tidy, walk the dog, even go to the gym. We saw her at all our baseball games, cheering like a crazy woman from the sidelines, and even got to go skiing with her in the winter. We remembered that there was more to our mom than her cancer. But, during the pandemic, our mom started feeling worse. Her labs showed that the progression had picked up speed, and that her cancer was starting to take over. Because Multiple Myeloma is a rare form of blood cancer that destroys the bone marrow, there’s nothing to take out with surgery (unless you have a vampire handy!). In April, she told us that her cancer doctor was suggesting that it was time for treatment. None of us have had cancer, so we really didn’t know what that meant. Our mom explained that her treatment would take about six months and would have two different stages to it: during the first stage, she takes chemotherapy pills and shots and is able to work, as long as she feels OK. During the second phase, she will have to check into the hospital for a few weeks and will get very aggressive chemotherapy infusions. If all goes well, she’ll be eligible for stem cell transplant after that (how she will be able to grow new bone marrow after they kill off all hers!). While our mom has been able to take care of us for this first part, she won’t be able to even take care of herself during the second part. Our mom’s best friend, Jen will come to live with us for about three months so that we can focus on school and Jen can take care of mom when she comes back from the hospital. We know that we’re going to have to give her a lot of love, and time to sleep (apparently that’s when you grow new bone marrow), but she’s going to need a lot more than we can provide. Our mom has always been that person who has taken care of others (it’s her job, too), but now that she is sick, she needs help. We want our mom to focus on getting better, not on the making dinner or keeping the house clean. We can do a lot about that- and our neighbors have been so cool to sign up to bring us dinners, but then there’s stuff we just can’t do without your help. We want to make sure that mom has as little stress as possible- and money just seems to be the thing that adults stress about! Knowing that the house and office are paid for, and that we have what we need will let her do the only thing she needs to do: get better. Thank you so much for anything that you can do!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-daniel-yeadon-in-his-fight-with-cancer,Help Daniel Yeadon in his fight with cancer," Daniel Yeadon has had to fight cancer and various tumors for numerous years now. Daniel is a wonderful young man, but currently only makes a small amount of money helping the church with their online church services. Daniel's current tumor is in his vocal cord area, so he can barely sleep and talk. He is going in for a second biopsy, as well as talking with his oncologist about the new tumor that is wrapped around his lymphnode in his chest. I will be putting his whole story on this page within the week. I wanted to quickly get this page started because he has no way of paying these medical bills along the way, and he needs to focus on his surgeries as well as chemotherapy. I am asking you to continue to pray for Daniel, that God will clear the way for him through healing and for finances. Daniel Yeadon is an amazing person and would be the first to help someone else in need. Please pray and ask God what you should consider donating. God Bless you and keep Dan in your prayers.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/hkcf9-help-melissa-fight-cancer,Help Melissa FIGHT cancer,"Tara Montgomery is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Eugene Puzerov. If you know Melissa (Montgomery) Puzerov, then you have already felt loved, uplifted, or belly laughed because of her. Her love for others is unmatched and now she is in need for us to show our love for her and her family. Her journey started with a simple sneeze, causing pain in her back that increased day by day. After multiple doctor visit's and scans, on September 12th she was given the heart breaking news that it was, in fact, cancer that was causing this debilitating pain. As more results come in, the cancer has been found in other parts of the body including her brain. The first priority was to remove the tumor adjacent to her spine causing incredible pain and immobility. The risk of being paralyzed was high if this was not done immediately. The surgery was successfully performed, placing hardware on her spine and a cement that will destroy the remaining tumor in this area. The pain she was experiencing before has diminished but the healing discomforts from the surgery now begin. It is still unsure the magnitude or origin of her cancer as we await the results from biopsies taken and some that still need to be collected from her breast and cervical area. Melissa is determined to fight this cancer, doing whatever it takes to succeed. Changing her diet drastically by only intaking nutritious foods that will create an environment that reduces the cancer's ability to thrive is only the beginning. As you can imagine, the weight of all of this on Melissa and her family is incredible. Gino, her husband, has been a steadfast rock beside her. Their almost 3-year-old son, Guardian, is a source of pure joy for Mel but is unable to visit her in the hospital due to Covid restrictions. This precious family is the reason we are starting this fundraiser. We want to take any burden we possibly can off of their shoulders so they can focus on winning this battle against cancer. Medical costs, fueling Melissa's body for optimum healing, and every day financial responsibilities continue to grow. First, and foremost, your prayers for Melissa are paramount. Your prayers have been uplifting and filling our family with hope. We know God is capable of healing Melissa and providing a miracle. God's unseen hand in guiding the circumstance and treatments so far is undeniable. In addition, if you are able to give monetary support, this blessing will make a huge impact on her family. Thank you all for your support for Melissa, Gino, and Guardian. What a blessing you are to them. As we learn more on this journey, I will update you frequently. ",44092,50000,18-Sep-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/mom-gets-cancer-miracle-after-56-rounds-of-chemo,Mom gets Cancer Miracle after 56 rounds of Chemo," IMPORTANT!!! THIS IS A SURPRISE FUNDRAISER FOR THE LOPRINZI FAMILY. BE SURE TO KEEP THE SECRET!We're here to celebrate! We're here to love on this family! We're here because God gave Kristina a miracle! WONDER WOMAN: Kristina is a wife and mother of four who three years ago got the devastating news no one wants to hear: cancer. For the last THREE years, she has been battling stage 4 ovarian cancer, with Wonder Woman strength, to live just a little bit longer. To see her children grow a little bit bigger. To celebrate her 16-year marriage to her high school sweetheart just one more year. Kristina lives in Mississippi and drove from her home there all the way to MD Anderson in Houston, Texas for chemo treatments every three weeks. She has spent weeks and weeks away from her young children. Missed countless milestones, birthdays, holidays. All in the name to live just a.little.bit.longer. And all while loving Jesus and proclaiming His faithfulness and goodness.She is a testimony of what walking faithfully through a trial truly looks like and how to trust in God’s plan even when it makes no sense; even in her darkest days, she kept her eyes on Him and praised Him. Those who have followed her journey have been blessed by being able to witness how God moves and uses His people. For His glory and our Gain! Amen! She has endured endless complications after every round of chemotherapy; Thoracentesis and pleurodesis procedures and numerous hospitalizations for sepsis, meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, and pulmonary embolisms. On October 22, 2021, Kristina once again arrived at MD Anderson in Texas, this time for a lung biopsy, because just three days prior a CAT scan showed a mass in her lung, and not ten days prior to that she was in the ICU with complications from her 56th round of chemo. As a part of her normal routine, she sat and waited for her PET scan results. A MIRACLE: After 56 rounds of chemo, and fighting with every ounce of her being for her life, Kristina's oncologist called her with words she never anticipated to hear, ""medicine cannot account for the changes from your scan done 3 days ago, to the one from today. God is in the business of miracles, to keep you in the 'business of living' and I'm so thrilled to say...your pet scan showed no evidence of disease!"" NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE. ZERO. A MIRACLE. GOD. NOW WHAT: What do you do after receiving information like that?! Well in true spunky Kristina fashion she cried an ocean of tears. Tears that were a mix of joy, relief, and complete exhaustion. She jumped up and hugged 3 random people on the beach, did a jumping heel click, and a cartwheel. Then yelled at the top of her lungs, ""thank you Jesus!"" But let's also talk about the weeks and months that now follow. She is now left with tremendous medical debt, because cancer not only robs your health and time from your family, it robs your bank account. She has six potentially life-threatening rounds of chemo left, plus another year of light chemo after that for maintenance. So the stress on her body, family life, and income will be continuing, along with the chemo. A SURPRISE: As we stated above: We are here to celebrate. We are here to love on this family. We are here because God have Kristina a miracle. Kristina recently confided in a friend that because she has given up so much precious time with her kids with the hopes that she would get more time with them one day in the future, all she wanted was to take her kids to Disneyworld to make up for all the lost time. SO LET'S DO THIS! Let's gather together here and aim for BIG goals. I mean, if Kristina can do 56 rounds of chemo, we can meet a 30k goal, right??! SO LET'S DO THIS! Let's gather together here and help send this family to Disneyworld to celebrate! To celebrate a miracle from God. To celebrate as MD Anderson's first and only woman in their history with ovarian cancer to ever receive this many rounds of chemotherapy. To celebrate LIFE! SO LET'S DO THIS! Let's gather together here and donate so we can SUPRISE her and her family with this gift! SO LET'S DO THIS! Also, let’s gather and support her family with their medical bills, yeah?! Meeting this $30,000 goal will not only allow for a magical vacation to help them heal as a family, but will also help to begin to pay down her medical debt. SO LET'S DO THIS!

If you have known her as Laurie Johnson, Laurie Daniells, or Laurie Marks...you have known one of the kindest and most creative humans. Laurie was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic breast cancer in early 2016, and she has been blessed to live another five (almost six) years beyond her diagnosis considering her a long-term survivor. This summer, Laurie was gardening in her front yard and fell down an unsecured water meter hole. Unfortunately, the injury did not respond to treatment and has continued to limit her mobility. This, combined with her progressive and terminal cancer, has made it almost impossible for her to leave her split-level home. Over the past few months Laurie has developed a deep appreciation for the simple pleasures; a stroll around the neighborhood in her wheelchair, a trip to her favorite coffee shop for a vegan scone, or taking a shower! Now, as she enters hospice care, she deeply needs fresh air on her skin and sunshine on her face. Please help us raise the funds to purchase a chair lift. Please help us give Laurie the ability to leave her home AND stay in her home while receiving hospice care. The chair lift will greatly increase Laurie's quality of life. Thank you in advance for your generosity, kindness, and love. Warmest regards, Laurie's favorite daughter, RyaUpdate 10/29/21:We have increased the fundraising amount to cover the entryway ramp build and installation.  ",4500,5000,3 days

We need to pull harder. Hi, I'm Wolfie. I was born at Moetown and I've been here my whole life -- 14 years! I've been one of Frank's best lead dogs for many, many races. But my proudest achievement was being one of his leaders when we ran from home to the capital in St. Paul to deliver signatures opposing mining in our beautiful backyard. I may be an old dog now, but I can still help train those crazy puppies and keep them in line. I'm pulling for Frank and I know you are too...help me lead Frank back home!Frank is at Courage Kenny in Minneapolis.  Brain surgery on August 4th was successful.  And radiation and chemo have been successful in shrinking the 5% of the tumnor that was not removed by surgery.  Sherri, the love of his life and rock of his existence, remains by his side. Frank and Sheri are both self employed. Sherri has a therapy practice and Frank has an outdoor guiding practice. And in the winter, they mush. And back in Hovland, MN, a 40 dog kennel needs tending. The Funds raised from this campaign will help cover the loss of revenue from Frank and Sherri's businesses, the expense of the kennel, co-pays and other insurance shortfalls, living expenses for Sherri while supporting Frank, etc.. We have shared a video below of Frank with Indy the Blind Dog. Our belief is if Indy can race again after going blind, Frank can race again after surviving brain cancer.

We are a group of family and friends who are fundraising for Nikolas Sperounis & his Family. Nik is a 17-year-old student-athlete at Chelmsford High School, where he plays on both the Varsity Football & Wrestling teams. He is an outgoing and charismatic kid. Nik was to start his Junior year at Chelmsford High School this month, with his cousins and all his friends. He had been preparing and looking forward to a great 2021 season with CHS Football and battling it out on the mats with the Wrestling team. He, like every other teenager, was dreaming of sports, parties, Jr. Cotilion, and all the other fun and exciting things that go along with being in High School. Unfortunately, life for Nik and the Sperounis Family has taken a serious and heartbreaking turn in what seems like a blink of an eye. Recently, Nik was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer - Angiosarcoma. He has begun treatment and care with Dana Faber, Jimmy Fund Cancer Center. Nik faces a long road ahead of him, one no one, especially a child should ever have to face. We want to help lessen the burden, so Nik and his family can focus solely on his care and his health. The financial challenges they may face could be insurmountable – travel expenses, medications, medical equipment, insurance deductibles and lost income. We appreciate your contributions however big or small. We also know not everyone can offer a monetary donation - we ask for your thoughts and prayers as Nik fights this cancer.

Adelaide is 8 years old and lives with her parents, Keegan and Kelly, and her younger brother Hudson in northeastern Connecticut. Adelaide is known for having a kind spirit, her silly sense of humor, and the great joy she takes in her friendships. She is an enthusiastic student and would like to be a teacher someday like her daddy and grandmother. She loves to play sports, including softball and soccer. She is a huge fan of the Liverpool soccer team and passionately cheers them on with her family! Adelaide was just beginning the third grade when doctors found a fast growing tumor. She was diagnosed with a form of cancer known as Rhabdomyosarcoma. She has recently begun a year long treatment involving chemotherapy, radiation and eventually surgery at Boston Children's Hospital. Not all of the medical care she requires is covered by insurance. We are raising money to help cover her medical costs and to allow her parents to be with her while she undergoes treatment. We hope to ease the financial burden for this family and allow them to be together to support Adelaide in her healing. We believe that when communities come together it can be very powerful. Please join us in lifting up this family and extending generosity in their time of need. If you feel moved, please send love and prayers to Adelaide Bay and her family.

Finally, please join us in sharing how Coach Wakefield has influenced you or your family, or just share a great Wakefield story on this page. We chose GoFundMe for it's ease of processing, and its security financially. If you're able to consider donating to his expenses, our goal is to raise $5,000, which is the cost of his annual deductible. UPDATE: Thanks to the generosity of so many, we are happy to say we hit our first goal so have updated it to $12,500. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL!! Any amount you’re able to give is extremely helpful! Please consider forwarding this to anyone you know who may be able to help...past team members or people you have in common with Coach. It will all help to make a difference and hopefully alleviate some stress for him at this time. (Note: We researched many fundraising sites, and were pleased to see only a 2.9% transaction fee with GoFundMe.

I asked his wife to tell his story as she does a beautiful job of it. Here is Dan's story in his wife, Liz's, words. ""My mother-in-law asked me if I would write Dan's story to share with everyone, it took me awhile to even start. I have a hard time thinking about it, let alone writing about it, which is why it's been several months since I've even posted. To bring it all to mind means there's tears and emotions I try very hard to avoid reliving. It's not the life we planned or imagined or dreamed about. It's a life that, most days, leaves me drained, exhausted and with pain in my innermost being. It's days that I literally feel like I'm going crazy and so many big decisions that I feel like running away, but God has us. He's holding us. He already knows the plan and we just have to be still and listen.  Almost 2 years ago in December, Daniel had multiple seizures that he was barely coming out of. I helped him to the car, we drove our babies to my sister's house and then proceeded to the hospital. He was unconscious for most of the trip but woke up enough to puke multiple times on the way to the hospital. We arrived at the emergency room, but he was barely able to walk and threw up as soon as we came in the door. They took him straight back to the one open bed left and did some blood work. It was so very lonely waiting for results as Dan was unconscious. When they finally came back, there was about 6 people coming in to talk to me. I remember the lady-doctor was very kind and put her hand on my shoulder and asked if there was someone I would like to come and sit with me. Then she told me Daniel was in kidney failure. She didn't know what was wrong, but they were gonna have to keep him for a few days. Everything else they said was just a blur. They ended up doing a biopsy that confirmed he has an autoimmune disease. There has been many ups and downs since then. So many answered prayers! We've had good days and weeks where his kidney function went up and he felt good! But we've also had some crazy hard days. Days we weren't sure he was going to make it. Days we felt so unbearably weighed down. Days that, in the overwhelming chaos, we took our eyes off Christ trying to depend and trust in ourselves. But we are learning to trust God and His plan for us. It may not be what we imagined or hoped for in this life, but God's strength is made perfect in our weakness. Everything we are not, He is! His kidney function has remained low for several months now and he is starting to have other issues related to the kidney failure, so... we have been referred to a transplant team at the Mayo Clinic. It's huge and scary and I'd really just like to close my eyes until it's over. I had no idea how incredibly extensive each step that goes into preparing for a transplant is. It's so unimaginably complicated and there are so many aspects that need to be arranged and coordinated that it's unreal. So many expenses that won't be covered. Details that seem impossible. I know our life will be turned upside down again and we can't do it without everyone of you standing with us! But we know that God will make a way where there seems to be no way!"" ""Jesus looked at them and said,' With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.' Matthew 19:26"" The disease Dan has is called IgA, also known as Berger's disease. He has been out of work since that hospital trip in December 2019. They will have to move cross country for most of a year for the transplant process and recovery.  ",7680,50000,10-Oct-21

He’s had a rough journey these past 5 years dealing with many illnesses, mainly cirrhosis (chronic liver disease) , high blood pressure,  stomach ulcers, hemorrhoids, loss of blood and etc. Before anything I would like to note that my dad has been cleaned and sober of any drugs for 38 years,  medications and past life decisions are what put him in this situation but he’s a better person and us as a family are just hoping for a miracle so my father can stay with us for a longer period of time or whatever god can allow us to have him for.  He will go into surgery soon to stop the bleeding from his abdominal and colon. So my family and I are seeking help to cover his medical expenses such as medications, trips to the hospital, treatments and just anything to help my father in general. We would greatly appreciate any help anyone can offer or give, especially a prayer in these hard times. Thank you so much In advance and may god bless who ever reads this.  ",2965,2000,1 day
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-brittany-get-back-in-the-spotters-tower,Help Brittany get back in the spotters tower," Many of you may not be aware, my sister in law Brittany Waszak has been in the hospital since last Wednesday. While Brittany keeps things very private, we wanted to share an update on what has been happening the past few weeks with Brittany and the family. A few weeks ago Brittany went to the ER for an excruciating headache that extended down her neck. It was different than any migraine she’s ever had. At the ER, she had a CT scan and they said she had a bad sinus infection and prescribed strong antibiotics. I saw her a few days later at her daughter's birthday party at the trampoline park. Thankfully she didn’t jump with her kiddos because she was still having headaches 5 days later after being in the ER. After about 10 days the headaches seemed to almost go away which was great, but then they started coming back. She thought maybe this time it was allergies as she hadn’t been diligent about taking her allergy meds. A few days later after the headaches returned she woke up with excruciating pain again and also had tingling on the left side of her body. They called 911 and she was taken by ambulance to the local ER after they got the kids situated. That hospital ran some tests and within a couple hours had her transferred to Lutheran General Neurology ICU. There they ran test after test and determined that she had a stroke. During this time, she couldn’t open her eyes without everything spinning and without any balance or coordination she was unable to stand up! After running all the tests they found the stroke was caused by a dissection of the vertebral artery. None of us can understand how a 34 year old healthy Mom of 2 littles was able to be up cutting hair at the salon and having dinner the night before now is unable to even open her eyes much less attempt to stand or even get out of bed. As of 10/20/21 she has now been In the hospital for 8 days and is praying that they might release her before the weekend. While going through her own therapies and trying to get stronger each day, the hardest part for Brittany is being away from her family. She misses her girls! Piper age 2 and Charley age 6 can’t visit Brittany in the hospital due to being under the age of 12. The girls really want Mom home (FaceTime is just NOT the same) and there is nowhere she’d rather be but with them. The amount of daily therapy is brutal and Brittany is trying to continue with the Doctor team recommendations to be in the hospital for monitoring. The second hardest part is Brittany accepting and understanding her limitations right now and asking for help. She would never ask anyone for help which is why I started this.  Anyone who knows Brittany knows she has the biggest heart and she would bend over backwards for anyone. She is such a caring, selfless, giving person. She doesn’t know I’m doing this and if she did she’d probably tell me not to if she knew in advance, but I know how much help they are going to need supporting their family in these next few months with time, services and the extraordinary costs they are now facing for her current treatments and follow on care these next few months. It will add up quickly financially between 2ER visits, 2 ambulance transports, Neurology ICU, and 2 weeks in the hospital doing therapy / rehab.  For someone who is self employed taking any time off work can add unneeded stress, so let's take some of that off her plate while she gets herself back to healthy and ready to work again.  Brittany isn’t just my favorite sister in law because she’s the only one I have but because she’s one of my favorite people in my life. No matter what has been going on, she has always been an optimistic friend, Mom, sister, family member. I want Brittany to have a little less to worry about with the impending bills that will start coming and to be able to take care of herself first, even though she is making progress daily, the physical road ahead is going to be difficult. We all love you Britt and we’re here to help. You’ve got a great support system!!!!!! Please share this so that we can get as much support for Brittany and the family as we can. If you are unable to donate and able to share, we appreciate that just as much! ",19425,5000,20-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-the-fintel-family-pay-medical-expenses,Help The Fintel Family Pay Medical Expenses," Hi All! My name is Stephanie Reeves and my dear friend Amanda Fintel is hospitalized with a brain tumor.  On 10/14 after Amanda had gone to bed, she had a grand mal seizure just three weeks after she had her sweet baby girl, Kate. Upon arrival to the hospital, a CT scan showed that Amanda had a 5 cm brain tumor. She was then transferred to Toledo Hospital to receive care from their Neuro Surgery team.  The tumor and seizures were affecting her speech. The plan was to have her seizure subside to then do an awake craniotomy in an attempt to remove the tumor. As of now, 10/21 her seizures have stopped and she is scheduled for surgery Monday, 10/25. The Neuro Surgeon plans to try and remove the tumor without having an impact on her speech. If they are unable to remove all of the tumor, the plan is to then go through 6 weeks of radiation treatment to shrink the tumor.  Amanda is probably one of the most amazing people I have ever met. She is an amazing Interventional Specialist at a local Junior High and a phenomenal volleyball coach at Perrysburg High School. She is always putting others before herself and is just such an exceptional role model and friend to her peers, friends, players, and family. I honestly cannot say enough about how special Amanda is. Amanda and her husband, Kyle have a sweet baby girl at home who is just three weeks old! As you can imagine, a diagnosis like this can be terrifying but add not being able to be with your 3 week old baby is just impossible to think of. Even with this life-changing situation, Amanda remains the most positive and upbeat person. She will do whatever it takes and is ready to fight this for her husband and baby girl.  Me, along with the Perrysburg High School Volleyball Head Coach, Laura Davidson, wanted to create this GoFundMe in hopes our family, friends, and community will help raise money for Amanda and her family so they can pay their medical expenses. Thank you for any donation, as I know Amanda and Kyle will be so appreciative.  ",24225,50000,21-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/friends-of-reggie-robinson,Friends of Reggie Robinson,"MIKE FALCONE is organizing this fundraiser. Our friend Reggie Robinson, one of the top athletes ever to come out of the Main Line, needs our help. Reggie enjoyed a distinguished career in basketball at Radnor High School and Villanova University. At Radnor he played baseball, football, track and basketball. At the time of his graduation in 1974, Reggie was Radnor’s all-time leading scorer and was named All-Scholastic, a Central League All-Star, and a Prep All-American. Radnor H.S. inducted Reggie into its Hall of Fame in 2006. From 1975 through 1978 Reggie was a stalwart of the Villanova Wildcats, led by coach Rollie Massimino. He averaged 11 points per game over a total of 119 games, and pulled down a total of 559 rebounds. He captained the 1977-78 squad which made the NCAA Tournament Elite Eight. Reggie played professional basketball in Europe. In 2003 he was named to the Villanova Hall of Fame. Reggie suffers from Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and is now completely confined to a wheelchair. To make things more comfortable for him and his entire family, we’re looking to raise funds to help enhance his daily life. There are several specific projects we are targeting: - Renovations to their home which would include converting the garage into an open room with easier access to and from other areas of the house. - Buying a new, more modern wheelchair - Purchasing a van to allow Reggie and his family to travel comfortably outside of their residence. - Providing a financial cushion to allow for him and his wife to meet other expenses, especially those related to his continuing medical care We have set a goal of generating $250,000 in this effort. Any amount you can donate to help Reggie and his family would be greatly appreciated. An account has been set up with Wells Fargo to collect donations and pay expenses. The account will be administered by two of Reggie’s teammates from Radnor – Mike Falcone (Class of 1974) and Chuck Hemcher (Class of 1975). Any expenses submitted to the account will be reviewed and approved by the Foundation’s Oversight Committee which consists of three of Reggie’s teammates from Villanova – Joe Rogers (Class of 1977), Keith Herron (Class of 1978) and Whitey Rigsby (Class of 1978).

As some of you know he was diagnosed with cancer. I've had the honor of working with him and being his good friend for 15 years. Here is what I know. John is a strong/proud man and will fight this with everything he has within him, but he needs your help. After 17 months of furlough from his job, John was diagnosed with metastatic cancer. I've lost others before to this awful disease and do not intend to lose another. John's illness was sudden and the situation is urgent. Working and the normal day-to-day that we take for granted is not an option right now and the financial burden is mounting. All of those who care about John have instructed him to focus on his health and this is where I ask you for help. The stress of the financial side of cancer is where I am asking for your donation help. So, if you could please help with words of encouragement and a donation to help John's fight we would be eternally grateful. Anything you can spare is appreciated and every little bit helps. I'm appealing to the kindness of your heart and I rarely ask anyone for help, but i'm asking on John's behalf. Please donate and share to help us reach our goal as this man that NEVER asks for help needs your help, love and support. I have full confidence that together we can lift his spirits and allow him to focus on the real important parts of life which are health and family. This word is a better place with John Gavan in it and let us as a community lift his spirit as he fights to win this battle with the ugly enemy called Cancer.

My wife gave birth to Daniel on 10/19/2021 near Buffalo, NY.  We came home on the 21st and we were really so happy to have our family complete again. On the 22nd she started experiencing really bad abdominal pains. She collapsed on the morning of the 23rd in our home and she was rushed to the emergency room by ambulance.  Before I could blink, she was in the operating room to repair a major internal arterial bleed in her stomach.  She was on a ventilator, she went through major surgery and had a large incision on her stomach.  She currently has 5 more days in the ICU before hopefully she could come home to her baby.  The reason I am requesting donations is for when she does come home.  I am afraid of health complications and I am terrified of something going wrong.

Ashley breast fed both of our other other boys for over a year each and it will difficult for me to pay for baby formula. I am not greedy and I will be so greatful if I raise enough money to help me buy a few containers of baby formula for Daniel.

Most of you are already aware of our father’s health situation. In June 2020 he was diagnosed again with cancer, this time in his liver. Is not easy to have cancer in any country, but in Venezuela is particularly difficult, making it a less than a smooth ride. One month ago our dad had to be hospitalized due to complications from a heavy bacterial infection. In yet again another pitfall, one of his kidneys was punctured during a procedure. Our father has had already five (5) blood transfusions and on-going dialysis sessions, making a small but slow recovery while still in hospital. Even though we are fortunate enough to have a medical insurance covering some of his cancer treatment, further costs during hospitalisation are piling, adding to more than we can afford as a family. Here is where you come in, hopefully helping us raise the needed funds to pay the extra cost from the clinic. We are humbled by your support and to those that suggested we put this page up. Together, we are doing everything we can to help our father in this process, wishing him a speedy recovery and a safe and prompt return back home! On behalf of our family, we want to thank you for your donation, like, share, prayers and simply for caring for our father’s health. Thank you, Meli Nobile Revel-Chion y Oswaldo (Tito) ------ Queridos amigos, Estamos aquí para pedir su apoyo. La mayoría de ustedes ya conocen la situación de salud de nuestro padre. En junio de 2020 le volvieron a diagnosticar cáncer, esta vez en el hígado. No es fácil tener cáncer en ningún país, pero en Venezuela es particularmente difícil, por lo que ha hecho de este capítulo más agotador de lo normal. Hace un mes, nuestro papá tuvo que ser hospitalizado debido a complicaciones de una fuerte infección bacteriana. Adicional a ello, en un procedimiento médico durante esta hospitalización, uno de sus riñones fue perforado. A la fecha, nuestro papá ya ha recibido cinco (5) transfusiones de sangre y está en proceso de varias sesiones de diálisis, con una recuperación lenta pero segura, aún estando hospitalizado. Aunque somos lo suficientemente afortunados de tener un seguro médico que cubre parte de su tratamiento contra el cáncer, los costos adicionales durante la hospitalización se están acumulando, a una suma mayor de lo que podemos pagar como familia en estos momentos. Aquí es donde pedimos tu apoyo, con suerte, ayudándonos a recaudar los fondos necesarios para pagar el costo adicional de la clínica. Nos sentimos honrados por el apoyo que hemos recibido hasta el momento, y por aquellos que sugirieron que pusiéramos esta página. ¡Juntos, estamos haciendo todo lo posible para ayudar a nuestro papá en este proceso, deseándole una pronta recuperación y un regreso seguro y rápido a la casa! En nombre de nuestra familia, queremos agradecerles por su donación, compartir esta página, sus oraciones, y simplemente por cuidar la salud de nuestro padre.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-zach-re,Help Zach Schimmel Recover from Brain Tumor!,"Sean Bligh is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Alexandria Schimmel. For those of you that do not know, Zachary Schimmel, who is only 27 years old, has been medically sedated, on a ventilator, in a Neurological Intensive Care Unit for about 1 week now (Since July 31st). He has had 2 brain surgeries and is unable to talk, or breath on his own. As of now Zach is unaware of what is happening. He has been medically sedated since the first seizure Saturday and is still unaware of his current condition. For a detailed timeline on what has happened so far medically, please see below. The doctors are expecting him to be in the ICU for at least another month, and are saying that it will be months before Zach is able to work, drive or live anything near a normal life again. We are unsure of when he will be released from the hospital. We are asking for help to cover his expenses to relieve any additional stress on himself, Carrie, & his family at this time. While we are still in the waiting process, his medical bills are continuing to grow, and like many people around our age, Zach is uninsured and has yet to build much savings. We are asking for any kind of support that could be provided, whether that is financially, by donating, or by sharing this link with as many people as you can. We will continue to update all of you on his progress and care, as we get updates ourselves. Before this past weekend, Zach and his girlfriend, Carrie, were approved for their first apartment together. Their move-in date was Sunday, August 1st, the day after he was taken and admitted into the hospital. Carrie has not left Zachary’s side since this has happened and is quickly running out of her sick days and vacation days. On top of everything going on with Zach, Carrie is now left with the responsibility of caring for all of their expenses alone, while also trying to be at his side. While we will have a lot of bad news for Zachary when he wakes up, we are hoping that through this GoFundMe, we will be able to give him some good news as well by showing him how much love and support he has and by having this donation fund to take some of this weight off of himself & Carrie, by helping to pay for all of his expenses. DETAILED TIMELINE: On Saturday July 31st Zachary was celebrating the gender reveal of his good friend’s baby when he unexpectedly collapsed at the party. He was taken to the nearest hospital, thinking he had heat exhaustion and needed rehydration, but on the way to the hospital he began having seizures in the ambulance. At the hospital they found that Zach’s brain was enlarged and he had hydrocephalus (extra fluid on the brain). After running multiple tests, the CT revealed that he had a brain tumor. They tried to have an MRI done to get a better picture of the tumor but unfortunately it was not possible because Zachary had another seizure during the procedure. It was at this time that Zachary was transferred to another local hospital to have emergency brain surgery, to install a drain into his head. This was to drain the extra fluid and relieve as much pressure off his brain as possible. Once some of the pressure was relieved, they successfully performed an MRI which showed that he had a 4cm tumor between his 3rd and 4th ventricles, pressing on his pineal gland (right in the center of his brain). The doctors waited 1.5 days to perform surgery to allow some of the brain swelling to go down before operating. Monday August 2nd, Zachary went in for surgery to remove the tumor. Unfortunately, the doctors were unable to remove all of the tumor, due to how deep it was within the brain. The part of the tumor that was removed was sent to a laboratory at Duke University to have testing done to determine the type of tumor and what treatment the remaining part will need moving forward. Pathology can take about a week to get back, so we are still waiting to hear those results. Since surgery things have been quite a rollercoaster ride. Zachary has been kept medically sedated and is still on a breathing tube, using a ventilator to breathe. His brain pressures (ICP: intracranial pressure), have not been stable, they are constantly elevated and he needs fluid drained from his brain every hour. He has also spiked a fever, with his temperature sitting at about 101 degrees, even while taking around the clock Tylenol. He has not been able to be woken up, due to his continuously unsteady ICPs and his elevated heart rates. Wednesday August 4th, overnight, into Thursday August 5th, Zachary had fallen from his bed, resulting in many of his monitoring devices being removed (ripped off). The drain in his head (which also measures his ICP) was ripped out, his ventilator tubes were disconnected, and his arterial line was ripped out. Zach did have his head drain reinstalled but the resulting damage from the drain being removed so rapidly/traumatically is unknown. Unfortunately we will not know if there is any damage until the doctors are able to un-sedate him and wake him up. Today, Zachary is still medically sedated. We are waiting to hear what the next plan of action is. Once we receive an update, we will update all of you as well. ",55968,150000,5-Aug-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ambers-army-boot-the-bills,"Amber's Army - ""Boot the Bills!""","Gerald Hughes is organizing this fundraiser.    In the Spring of 2021 Amber Pluzycki was diagnosed with paraganglioma, a rare tumor growing from the carotid area of her neck, behind her ear, up into her brain. After hearing her diagnosis the world stopped for this 21 year old. Her days are now filled with multiple doctors appointments, diagnostic testing, bloodwork and more. After meeting with the best specialist in the Chicagoland area the decision was made to operate. The surgery was done at Rush University Medical Center and lasted over 11 hours - performed by a team of surgeons. Most of the tumor was successfully removed and a feeding tube was placed.   After the long and exhausting surgery Amber's road to recovery was quick to begin. She had a weeklong stay in the hospital where she could recover and relearn her basics such as eating, swallowing and talking. Now almost 2 months postop Amber is improving greatly - her feeding tube has been removed, her vocal cord muscles are getting stronger and her spirits are better. Even though she's only in the beginning of her recovery journey the bills are already starting to pile up. Our family's doing all they can to support her but it's simply not enough. Amber is a loving aunt, godmother, daughter, sister and friend. She truly has the most genuine and beautiful heart. As she puts the pieces of her life back together her main focus should be on recovery. The last thing she should have to worry about is her bills.   So we are asking you to reach into your hearts and help her rise above the setback. From the bottom of our hearts we truly thank you...   With our appreciation.

After a few weeks of doctor's visits, the Dobbs family received news that no parents ever wants to hear: Hollis has cancer. Hollis was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma and has a large mass in his abdomen. It was decided in order to give Hollis the best chance at beating this cancer to move him to DC at Children's National Medical Center, a world renowned medical facility. Hollis has already started intense chemotherapy and may undergo surgery in the future depending on results. He needs an anticipated 9-12 months of chemotherapy. While we all are very hopeful that his treatment will be successful, this will be an incredibly difficult journey for Hollis and the Dobbs family. There are too many stresses to count. We can't magically cure Hollis, but we can try to help decrease the financial stress on their family. There will likely be many medical bills, cost of traveling, lodging, time away from work, child care for other kids, etc. Anyone that knows the Dobbs knows they are great people.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-for-our-beloved-ann-marie,Support for our beloved Ann Marie,"Team fundraiserKelly Santos and 0 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Alyssa Rojas. On the evening of September 21st, my beautiful mother Ann Dellisanti-Rojas was discovered in the middle of the night by my stepfather in the midst of suffering a set of what was determined to be multiple severe strokes, coming seemingly out of nowhere. After being rushed to the ER and admitted to ICU, Ann at only 49 years young, is now fighting for her life with each passing hour. It was discovered through scans that multiple bloodclots have formed and have been circulating throughout her body, and have collected in the arteries in the neck and brain, along with the side effects and post trauma of the strokes. She was quickly transferred to a larger Neurological Institution, and we are relieved that she is in the best hands in the country, but nevertheless we as a family are traumatized, terrified, and uncertain what the future holds. Ann has been kept medically unconscious and intubated for the 9 days as doctors work as hard as humanly possible 24/7 to pinpoint what the cause of this is and help to track and monitor her brain swelling, check the responsiveness of her body to the many treatments, and offer comfort to her in the best ways they can as she rests and tries to heal.  My mother currently has an unknown discharge date due to the instability of her condition, and the fact that news is changing on the hour as the specialists attempt to narrow down what may have happened and as she continues to clot mysteriously, despite her high level of blood thinners she is being administered-- all while being sure her other vitals and bodily needs remain stable.  Realistically, it breaks our hearts to say that we do not know her outcome, but are hoping with everything in our souls for the best for her and for her to wake up-- as we have been told if she recovers and continues to remain stable and eventually heal, this is going to be multiple weeks in the ICU, and then months if not years of rehabilitation resulting in a permanent disability for the rest of her life. Ann is going to have a very long road ahead of recovery as she is hopefully soon brought back to consciousness, becomes stable with her swelling, and eventually relearns mobility in her entire left side post stroke. Life will be different from now on, but as long as we have her with us-- we don’t care what the future holds. Ann was not known by herself or her family to have any prior health concerns or existing conditions, but doctors are assuming to the best of their ability that this is a culmination of many factors. It has been described as “the perfect storm” which is something no one wants to hear about the most important person in their lives and has touched the hearts of countless people and families through her kindness, humor, talents, and unconditional love for others. This has blindsided us. She does not deserve this. And as we gather to desperately figure out the next best steps, we humbly turn to all those who love her to help provide comfort and solace as we try to get our Annie better and create a comfortable life once she finally leaves the hospital. We have no idea what to expect both medically and financially. For many of you in Ann’s wider circles or as her clients and countless friends, this is our first public speaking out of the terrifying health events of the last week-- and may be the first you hear of this so far. We feel your deep pain and shell shock with this news-- and thank you for your good energies and prayers from all over the world. Especially we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for reading this update post, and for loving this incredible woman for all she has given, as well as all that she still has left to live. We’ve just got to get there. She will get through this, because she is the strongest woman anyone could know.  Through this GoFundMe and with the initial funds raised, we hope to cover any further unforeseen medical expenses/medical devices or accessibility options that may be uncovered, continue to cover Ann’s personal bills, take care of her beloved pup (my little furry brother) Cooper in her stead, and try keep her life outside the hospital running however we can while she is unable to move or speak. This will also help us as we navigate my potential job changes to accommodate for my mom’s now necessary full time care. Mostly, we hope to help prepare for a comfortable new home and routine for Ann. This financial goal number may change as life runs its course and we learn more about what we’re looking at in the long term, but we plan on updating those who love her as much as we can along the way here on this platform as we lift her up together.  We love our girl, Ann is everyone’s girl, she’s the most important person in my life, and we thank you for your much needed help her continue to fight-- and to make her life even more beautiful going forward. -Alyssa Rojas  ",35497,40000,29-Sep-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/j5dj7p-jamies-fight,Jamie's Fight," Hello. I’m Alicia, and I have set up this gofundme for my precious mother-in-law, Jamie. If you know Jamie then we don’t have to tell how great of a wife, mother, friend or Nana she is! You could always count on Jamie to help in any way she could. She is passionate about life, friends, and family. Especially her Grandchildren! In February Jamie began to get a lot of pain in her left side. So much pain in fact that she sought treatment. A colonoscopy was scheduled to look for the source of the pain but it was not discovered. Her pain was attributed to an earlier resection she had 11 years previous. This pain persisted and also began to appear in different areas of her abdomen. She again sought treatment with different doctors and specialists to no avail. She began having trouble keeping food down at the end of July. In fact the last full meal she had was July 29th 2021. Ever since that day she couldn’t keep anything down that she ate. Over the course of the next two and a half months her health declined. She continued to look for doctors that could pinpoint the cause of her problems with no success. On October 8th her health was in such a state of decline that the decision was made to take her to the ER to get answers. They treated her for what they thought was a small bowel obstruction. After being in the hospital for 6 days they determined that she no longer met the criteria to stay and sent her home. After unsuccessful attempts to hold anything down she was once again brought to the hospital on October 18th. After more testing they became concerned about certain cancer markers that were elevated. They were also concerned about the amount of fluid in her abdomen. She was admitted to UMC on the 19th. Two days later it was decided by the surgeons that they needed to perform exploratory surgery to find out what was going on in her abdomen. What they discovered was heartbreaking. They found Cancer throughout the entirety of her abdomen. Every organ was affected and showed different stages of growth. After pathology reports, the best they can tell is that she has stage 4 metastatic pancreatic cancer. The cancer has attacked her intestines which explains why she could not eat. Jamie has started chemotherapy treatments and is getting nutrition through a central line in her arm. This therapy is commonly referred to as TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition). This is the only source of nutrition that she has that is needed to try and fight this cancer. Jamie is a fighter and is trying to fight this! As you can imagine, medical treatments and hospital stays are expensive, even with insurance. If you would like to help Jamie in her courageous fight against cancer, our family would be forever grateful.  ",2650,20000,20 hours

Hello Beautiful People! My name is Marky the Rock, from my first day coming into this world, I've battled an illness very few know about called Epidermolysis Bullosa (aka butterfly skin- having only one layer of skin) with the subtype Kindler. EB is a rare but extremely painful disease, causing my body to be in fight-mode 24/7. My doctors gave me til I turned 14 years old; my birthday is next month and I'll be turning 21 years old. That's over two decades of living in pain every single day. But all this to say that for each day I'm given, I thank the Lord for the additional time I'm able to spend with my family, my dogs, and my friends, as well as singing out to the blaring sounds of my favorite rock music from the 70s & 80s!!! The Sanoviv Medical Institute, where my treatment will take place, has scientifically been proven to be ahead of ANY of the United States medical advancements with EB due to all the FDA regulations (why myself and the other people living with EB haven't had adequate treatment). Through treatment, they will provide my body the surplus of what my body doesn't produce itself (collagen, red blood cells, etc), speed up the healing process of wounds that have turned chronic and show no signs of healing, give me energy and reduce the time in bed, and most importantly- HELP REDUCE THE PAIN :) The reason for this campaign is that I've been given an incredible opportunity to begin a treatment that can considerably improve my quality of life. No, it's not a cure, but it is the first real hope I've been given in my lifetime. Thank you beyond words for YOUR love, support and generosity that you've shown me and my family!!!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/dees-fight-cancer-were-coming-for-you,"Dee's FIGHT: Cancer, we're coming for you!"," To say that the last two months have been heartbreaking would be an understatement. On September 5th, my mother Deanna Kuehling was working at St. Clara’s Rehab Facility as a nurse where she has been working for many years. My mom is someone who cares deeply for others in need, and she is one of the most respected nurses at her workplace in Lincoln, IL. Her entire life, my mother has put the needs and well-being of others in front of her own. As a single mother, she is the definition of strength. When I was 11 years old, my father died and my mom raised me on her own. Because of this, I fully believe that there is truly NOTHING that she cannot handle. Around 2am, I got ""THAT"" call. She was being rushed to the Lincoln Memorial Hospital ER for sudden heavy cervical bleeding. At that time, the doctors were understandably concerned about cancer. Due to bed shortages, she was then transferred to St. John’s Hospital in Springfield, IL., where they performed surgery to locate specifically where the bleeding was originating from. During this procedure, they discovered a mass, took a biopsy, controlled the bleeding, and sent my mom home. That car ride home with my mom felt surreal. Looking back, I know now that it was only the tip of the iceberg. I am an only child, and with my mother being my only living parent the tensions were very high. I had to be strong for my mom regardless of my own fears and emotions. After about 2 weeks we met with the doctor to discuss the biopsy results. We received the news that we were dreading: my mom was diagnosed with cervical cancer. At this point, due to the size of the mass, a hysterectomy was not in the cards for her. Their plan of attack was to start with scheduling a surgery to remove the lymph nodes on her pelvic wall, and to treat with radiation and chemo to prevent the further spread of the cancer. This was scary, because with a diagnosis like this, time is EVERYTHING, and the hurdles we needed to jump through started to seem endless. Fast-forward to the day of the surgery: we both felt hopeful that the cancer was only in her pelvic region. Prior to this surgery, I spent lots of lonely nights, cried many tears, and ran through every scenario imaginable in my head. Fear of the unknown and the uncontrollable is the emptiest feeling. I am petrified to lose the one person in my life who means the most to me. Surgery was scheduled to last between 4-7 hours. Only two hours into the surgery, the doctor asked to meet me in a consultation room to deliver the worst news of my entire life: the cancer had spread up her abdomen, and the option to remove her lymph nodes no longer existed. She was diagnosed with stage 4b cervical cancer, and chemo is the only option for treatment at this time. This was a major change from what we thought prior to surgery. The doctor told us that the average life expectancy for someone in her position is 17 months. My mom is only 57 years old. For me, forever is not enough time to spend with her. The gravity of the situation truly hit me during this moment. This was the worst day of my entire life. Even though it was the most devastating news, I am optimistic and hopeful that my mom will respond well to treatment. I have to be. Hope is all that we have. My family is agonizing over the news, but we will fight every second. We trust in God’s plan and we will tackle this head-on. I am dealing with coordinating my moms care by myself, and it’s taking a toll on me mentally and physically. I want to explore multiple opinions on her diagnosis, all which take time and money. Regardless of that, I need to know that we have explored every single avenue in order to do what is completely best for my mom moving forward. In order to keep her home life positive, my family and I are getting her house prepped and cleaned for when she starts chemo, so that she can completely relax. Recently, she got a haircut and color, and for the first time in a long time she feels so good about herself! With being around family during the holidays, we will be getting her a wig so that she can feel beautiful and confident around our extended family. As I mentioned before, this is a very time-sensitive situation. Know that if you decide to help, each donation will touch my heart. These donations will be used from this second until the unknown; they will go largely towards exploring multiple opinions, a growing stack of medical bills, and groceries/provisions while she is at home during treatment and displaced from work. If you have personally been affected by cancer in your life, or if you know someone close to you who has, you know how devastating this type of news is. Every single act of generosity gives me that much more hope. Thank you, and God Bless You!! Please share this with anyone you know, and say a prayer for my moms healing!  I will post updates as we move through this process of treatment, so that you can actively see how your donations have helped us. ",2840,10000,1 day

Help a Beloved Father and Comedian Rebound from Kidney and Congestive Heart Failure He goes by so many titles—Christian comedian, actor, friend, son, adviser, confidante—but the most important title of all is dad. For decades, Bone Hampton has brought joy and laughter to so many lives. He has traveled the country, uplifting downcast hearts and promoting laughter that encourages the spirit. He has devoted countless hours to honing his craft while inspiring and teaching young comics to do the same. By traveling to city after city, Bone has made a living, providing for himself and his son. Now, he is experiencing the fight of his life, and he needs our financial support. Because of the pandemic, opportunities to work in the entertainment industry disappeared. But during the summer of 2021, doors began to open, and life on the road seemed to be returning to normalcy. Unfortunately, another unexpected setback has beset him. He is experiencing congestive heart failure, as massive amounts of fluid are surrounding his lungs and heart, causing his kidneys to shut down. The result? A lengthy hospital stay and an even lengthier recovery and rehabilitation, which are yet to come. Despite the obstacles, his family and friends are confident in God’s healing power, and we look forward to the day when Bone is restored to full health. But he needs more than just our prayers and well wishes. His doctors have already informed and even ordered him to remain off the stage indefinitely, pending significant improvement in his heart and kidney function. This will be a long journey back to health, but we can help ease the worry and anxiety that result from the inability to work and provide. If you can bless Bone Hampton financially during this very trying circumstance, please contribute to his GoFundMe. All the money raised will be used to supplement his lost income and to pay for his mounting medical expenses. ",62017,100000,25-Aug-21

Lauren and Natalie were born on September 22, and were two sweet new additions to the Gatzke home in Grand Forks, ND. In their first week at home, the twins enjoyed time with their parents Ryan and Mallory, older sister Madison, their dog Duke, and grandparents. On September 24th, Lauren was hospitalized and diagnosed with hypothermia. After passing all tests and making a full recovery, Lauren returned home. On the afternoon of September 29th, Natalie had her first seizure and was rushed to the hospital. Natalie was diagnosed with meningitis, which required hospitalization and treatment down in Fargo. Initially, doctors predicted a 3wk stay at a minimum and with recent developments have pushed that timeline an additional week. Now, during the weekdays, Ryan and Mallory trade days down in Fargo with Natalie while the other takes care of Madison, Lauren, and Duke in Grand Forks - and the entire family travels each weekend to get as much time together and with new born Natalie as possible in the ICU. Natalie's recent MRI revealed swelling and further infection in her brain (hydrocephalus) which will require shunt treatment for the rest of her life; and on top of tough news, Natalie's heart has begun to display an abnormal echo. Needless to say, both twins are warriors, and so is this Gatzke family, but the treatment, traveling, and displacement has created a tough situation to handle.

He is loved by me and my boyfriend Taylor and our 3 other pups. When he's not at work with me he is out on an adventure or lounging on our bed at home, which makes what has happened even harder knowing this will all change if he doesn't get the help he needs.Castor wokeup Tuesday morning with wobbly legs. Right away when his symptoms started we tried to get him into our regular vet and unfortunately they were booked. We then took him to another vet that was amazing in helping us. At this point Castor could no longer use his back legs. Unfortunately because of size we couldn't get into a k9 orthopedic near us. We took him to a specialist in Parker Colorado at an emergency neurological center. Their the vet told us he is partially paralyzed in his hind legs with a possible slipped disc. We were recommended to get an MRI and if we found he has a slipped disc he would need to have emergency surgery. Sometimes these things can be healed with rest and meds. We took him home as we couldn't afford anything more. The MRI itself is 4,000$ and the surgery with MRI can range between 8-10,000$. We are here asking for your help to make sure our little dude can get the help he deserves and needs. We are also seeking alternate routes like accupunture but with a bleek outlook on actually helping him. He is on lots of medications and resting for now.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-rosemary-pay-for-breast-cancer-expenses,Help Rosemary Pay for Breast Cancer Expenses,"Marianna Vavitsas is organizing this fundraiser. My name is Marianna Vavitsas. My mother, Rosemary was recently diagnosed with ductal invasive carcinoma on her right breast on September 29th which has already spread to her lymph nodes. She had a mammogram a year ago but it did not detect any abnormalities, which means that in that time, she developed a malignant tumor, which unfortunately has already spread to her lymph nodes. As a result, her breast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma) is categorized as stage 2 (already approaching stage 3) and she will need to undergo chemotherapy, breast surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy TBD), and then radiation. It is estimated that the whole process can take about a year before she has the possibility of entering remission or recovery. My mother has been referred to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which will provide her the care and treatment she needs to overcome this battle. Although my mother has medicare (she is 65 years old), it will only cover 60% of her cancer treatment and appointments. The other 40% will be out-of-pocket expenses that she will need to incur. My mother is a low-income single parent living alone, in a modest home, who still works at a coffee-shop making minimum wage trying to pay off her bills. She has always been a very hard worker and did her best to provide for two children and provide a stable home for us, but she could not predict that she would be diagnosed with cancer and be in a situation where her medical coverage would not cover her fully. Although minimum wage in New York City is $15 an hour, it is simply not enough to be able to afford the cost difference of all of her treatments as well as all of her monthly bills. For a single consultation (no treatments, no radiation, no chemotherapy), my mom can be billed about $3000 per visit. Depending on the hospital and the doctor, chemotherapy per visit can be billed anywhere from $6,000 to $30,000 per visit. That would crush her financially. My mother has not yet formally begun any of her treatment, as she has just learned about her diagnosis, but she is preparing herself for what the next few months will look like. I have been living out of state and will be relocating to support her and my sister, who lives in Brooklyn, will also be helping in attending to my mother. This news has not been easy for any of us. To be honest, it was devastating, but my mother’s resilience reminds me of her strength. While I am supporting her as best as I can financially and emotionally, we still have a substantial gap in financial coverage. If we were to seek supplemental insurance, it would either (a) not begin to cover her for six months or (b) not cover all of the treatments related to her new diagnosis. She cannot afford the out-of-pocket expenses, and she is worried about being able to juggle her employment, pay her bills, and have to be treated for breast cancer. As a result I am asking you for your support in helping my mother. We are not asking for all of her expenses to be covered, just a portion so that a burden is lifted off of her shoulders. My mother is a very kind-hearted giving woman. As a token of your donation, after she completes her cancer treatment, we will find a way to thank you for your donation directly, as we believe that a thank you is never too late. Thank you for your help and support. May God bless you all  Best wishes, Marianna Vavitsas ",17360,20000,6-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-allison-cisneros-battle-cancer,Help Allison Cisneros battle cancer.,"Diana Mendez is organizing this fundraiser. I am Diana Mendez, and I am the mother and caregiver of Allison Cisneros, a beautiful 8 year old girl. On September 19th, 2021, my daughter and I came from Panama City, Panama to Miami, Florida, for a better chance to overcome her illness. She was diagnosed for the first time with leukemia type B, in December of 2020. Shorty after, Allison started chemotherapy treatments at El Hospital del Nino in Panama, but the treatment wasn't successful, and her health was starting to get worse. After her father had passed away in a horrible car crash, I decided to leave my family behind to get her and myself a visa, to come here and get second opinion and in hopes for a better and more successful treatment. On October 4th, 2021, we were still staying at the Holiday Inn, when Allison was rushed to Holtz Children's Hospital after suffering unbearable pains in her joints. After several studies and a biopsy, I was informed that my daughter has 90% of cancerous cells in her bone marrow, and chemotherapy was no longer a working option. The only treatment able to save her life is a bone marrow transplant, that is estimated to cost $500,000. Her doctors at Holtz Children's Hospital referred her to St. Jude's Children's Hospital, but she was denied because they did not have an open clinical trial to help her. My last option is to get the bone marrow transplant at the hospital I am currently at, but because she does not have medical insurance, nor a legal status in the United States, I will have to pay out of my own pocket, which is money I do not have. Allison deserves to be the kind, active, sweet little girl she was before getting this life-threating illness. She loved to play with her little sister Mayra, going to school and learning with her all her friends and all the other things an 8 year old girl loves to do. As a mother of a sick child, I am begging for your help to give my daughter, Allison a chance to live. Anything will help and is very appreciated. Thank you and god bless you all.

A swollen chest on 3-year-old Colton was first noticed by his “Oma” on August 31st. He was brought to the Albany Medical Center Pediatric ER and it was quickly understood that Colton’s condition could be serious. After testing, Colton was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a rare type of cancer and a diagnosis that no family ever wants to hear. Colton is a loving little 3-year-old who is quick to give out hugs and kisses. He’s a loyal fan of the Red Sox and Buffalo Bills. His older brother Mason and their dog “Gunney Boy” are always by his side. Colton is one of those kids with a contagious laugh and a smile filled with love. He does have a mischievous streak when he’s stealing his daddy’s snacks or trying to be a big boy like his older brother but all of that only makes you love him more! Colton has a long road ahead, but his cancer is treatable, and everyone remains optimistic. Colton has been transferred to Boston’s Children Hospital for 12 weeks of chemotherapy. After the 12 rounds of chemotherapy, the tumor will be surgically removed from Colton’s chest. He will then undergo an additional 4 to 6 weeks of chemotherapy, and possibly radiation treatments to make sure the cancer is gone. Overall, Colton’s medical care is scheduled to take anywhere from 9 to 12 months, but the fight could last much longer than that. Many people have asked how they can help further support Colton and his family by easing the burden of his medical bills, the costs of traveling to/from Boston and other costs that may arise. This page has been established to help collect donations to get them through these trying times.  With your generous support, we can continue to get Colton the very best care and help his family keep up with the mounting co-pays, travel expenses and other unforeseen costs caused by this situation.  There is no doubt that with your help we can get Colton back to being the fun-loving and adventurous little boy we all know and love!On behalf of the Teal family - THANK YOU for visiting this page, for keeping Colton in your prayers, and for your generous support!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/child-in-need-carolines-story,Child In Need: Caroline's Story," One of our own needs help. Please read. One Key Escrow family member Angela Cheng is a single mother whose daughter has recently lost functionality in her legs, hips, and eyes. Your generous donation will aid in covering the cost of multiple surgeries, as well as future rehabilitation, as 11-year-old Caroline will soon begin her journey towards recovery and hopefully regain the ability to walk.  How We Got Here: A parent’s worst nightmare came to life. The unthinkable became a reality in June 2021 when Angela Cheng’s daughter,  Caroline, had what appeared to be a simple scratch turn into a life-altering health complication. In the weeks following the discovery of a scratch on her leg, 11-year-old Caroline was subject to endure multiple surgeries due to a blood infection, which rapidly  turned into a bone infection (osteomyelitis). This infection caused trauma in both her hip bone and groin area. This left young Caroline vulnerable  to copious amounts of pain and discomfort.  Caroline stayed in Huntington Hospital in Pasadena for one and half months. High doses of IV antibiotic treatments weren’t effective. Instead, they caused further autoimmune distress. After undergoing two surgeries in an attempt to draw out the affected fluid, the infection spiraled out of control and the doctors decided to transfer her to The Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.  This is where her retina, an imperative part of our eye that affects our vision, detached.  As a consequence, she suffered loss in vision,  due to the autoimmune distress from the high levels of antibiotics in her body.  As a result, Caroline underwent yet another surgery, which ended up being ineffective. Her vision remains impaired.    As for the bone infection, Caroline recently underwent yet another surgery in which resulted in the bone being disaggregated. Meaning, they took out more affected fluid, as well as part of the bone within her leg in an attempt to relieve her of the infection. The outcome was uneven leg lengths, and screws and nails being put in place in absence of the bone. Now, it’s time for 11-year-old Caroline to be transferred to a rehabilitation center so she can start physical therapy and be trained to walk again.  After all they’ve been through, Mother Angela and Daughter Caroline remain an unbreakable duo with hope in their heads and hearts. They are turning to you for help.  Angela works long hours at One Key Escrow, and spends every ounce of time outside of work with her daughter in hospitals and rehabilitation centers.  We can’t take the pain away, or stress that comes with seeing a loved one suffer, especially a child. What we can do is rally around Angela Cheng and relieve her of the hefty burden of financial stress. Every single dollar counts. Your donation is going straight towards paying outstanding hospital bills, as well as future bills to come pertinent to Caroline’s recovery. This family needs you. Please, consider this when donating. Every parent wants to give their child the chance to live a high-quality life. We want to set Caroline up for success after all she’s been through with the best treatment possible. It’s been months of agony. Let’s get Angela and Caroline smiling again! #DonateForCaroline.

So a few weeks back my brother in law took a trip to the hospital to be checked out for concussions after a fall at work. After taking X-rays , they saw a few masses in his nasal and throat area and advised him to see a specialist as these masses didn’t look good. Seeing a specialist the following day, he was told it looked like cancer and they would need to biopsy it. Now, Fast forward to about a week after waiting for results.  He was told he had stage 2 then was told it was actually stage 3 Nasopharyngeal cancer , that it was inoperable , treatable , but inoperable. My brother in law at 36 years old was at loss for words. How can this be happening to me? His first thoughts, his wife and their 8 year old daughter , his words “ I’m going to beat this, I can’t afford to lose this battle” again with his family in mind. He will be undergoing comprehensive treatment. Chemo for the next 9 weeks and then chemo and radiation for another 7 weeks in Boston. Due to this unfortunate event , he will be unable to work and provide like he’s use to. With that said, I’m reaching out to all of our family and friends to try and help them stay somewhat afloat with the medical bills and everyday household expenses they will endure during this difficult time.  Anything will help, and will be greatly appreciated. We thank everyone from the bottom of our hearts and please keep them in your prayers.  ",3270,25000,2 days

He finally wants  to let everyone know what is going on due to needing help. Ariel started off being diagnosed with a fungus in his blood cells that were supposedly eating him from the inside out, at least that’s what they  thought. He was then diagnosed with inflammation of his colitis and liver failure and gallbladder stones and while going through all of these things his body slowly stopped functioning properly. Ariel got to the point to where his  fiancé had to shower him all while getting really high fevers so they started doing more test. Ariel had a Cerebrospinal Fluid Analysis due to his brain swelling and him starting to forget things. To finish it off he was diagnosed with (HLH) It is a life-threatening condition that can be defined as either primary or secondary HLH. Primary, or “familial,” HLH is when the condition is inherited. The term secondary HLH is used when your doctor thinks the condition may have occurred for a variety of other non-inherited reasons. In HLH, the immune system begins to damage the patient’s own tissues and organs, including the liver, brain and bone marrow where blood is made. Ariel is looking at a life or death situation, he is still awaiting on the results to see if the HLH has hit the point where it’s considered cancer or if it’s just a deadly disease. All of this has taken a toll on Ariel at just at the age of 26!!!! Since he’s been in and out of the hospital so much he hasn’t been able to provide for his family. Under his care are 4 beautiful children and his fiancé who has been struggling to provide herself. Anyone who knows Ariel knows how hard of a worker he has been since a young age. He is not one to ask for help but in this time of need/emergency Ariel could use the support of his family and friends or anyone who wants to help him out to pay for medical bills and other living expenses/bills. He thanks you all in advance who are willing to help with any amount that you can help him with. We ask that you also please keep him in your prayers and give him encouragement to keep positive while he battles this disease. God bless you all and thank you.  ",3108,5000,7 days

Arya has leukemia cells taking over her bone marrow at around 58%+ and around 20% in her blood. She has had several chemo treatments so far including into her spine.

This childhood cancer is seen in about 1 in every 10 cases and the hospital has only seen 1 of her type of cancer this year. They are starting her on a trial and her case is being overseen by several hospitals. Her prognosis is still developing while treatment has begun. Cancer is an overwhelming disease and is so tough when it is a child.Sharda has not worked since Arya was born, being a stay at home mom.

As many of you already know, Allistair was diagnosed with ALS in February of this year.  The past six months have been a whirlwind of activity, emotions, and time with loved ones.  Thanks to all of you and your generosity, we were able to take Allistair's ""bucket list"" trip to the Exumas, Bahamas to swim with the pigs and to Atlantis, Paradise Island Bahamas, to celebrate his 41st birthday (with 31 other people!).  He rates that trip among the top 3 of his lifetime!  THANK YOU!   Allistair's ALS continues to progress, and mobility is becoming much more of an issue.  He currently uses a ""Rollator"" walker to help lower his fall risk while he walks at home and at work.  At the most recent multi-disciplinary ALS clinic appointment we attended (in mid-August), his physical therapist met with us to discuss ordering him a wheelchair with the goal of helping him maintain his independence for as long as possible.  It was a tough conversation to have, but we are trying to be as proactive as possible, so the wheelchair has been ordered.  He even got to pick his preferred color (black-on-black, of course!).  The current house that we are renting is not very mobility-friendly for Allistair, and his evolving mobility challenges resulted in us pushing up our timeline to purchase a forever home.  We are super excited to announce that we are BUYING A HOUSE!  It is beautiful, was built in 2017, and is still located in Vienna.  We are sad to leave our amazing neighbors, but are happy to be within a 10 minute drive of everyone.  We will be closing on the house at the end of October and will be moving in at the end of December (the current owners are building a new house that won't be ready for them until December, so they will rent back from us for 2 months).  The new house is much more mobility-friendly for Allistair, but still needs quite a bit of work to make it optimally handicap-accessible.  We figured this would be another great opportunity for a Go-Fund-Me, to help us get our forever home in tip-top shape for Allistair's independent mobility and to facilitate creating meaningful family memories in our new home.    We are beyond blessed and fortunate to have such an AMAZING support network of friends and family, and we cannot thank everyone enough for all that you have already done.  The next couple/few years are going to be tough, but as I told our boys, our job is to just love Allistair as much and as hard as we can while he is still here with us.

I’m starting this fundraiser for my best friend/ brother John. John has been diagnosed with lymphoma cancer. This is his second time trying to fight off this horrible cancer. John is currently traveling  from Las Vegas to the Mayo Clinic in Arizona so he can get a bone marrow transplant. This is the only thing the doctors can do to try to save his life. John is a father of two young beautiful children, and a loving husband to his wife Dani. Due to his wife being the only one able to work, they’re currently struggling to pay for treatment. After John gets his bone marrow transplant he will have to stay in Arizona for a few months. He can not be more then 30 minutes away from the clinic.  Being said Dani will not be able to work and provide income during this time. Unfortunately, they will have to rent a AirBNB. I am  asking our friends, family, and community to help out this loving family. Anything you can provide will make a difference. Thank you all and God Bless.  ",5576,15000,15-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-emali-conquer-breast-cancer,Help Emali Conquer Breast Cancer," Mahalo nui loa for being here. I could use your help to raise funds for my sister's cancer treatment. Please read her story from her husband's perspective: Aloha, My name is Dennis Day and I'm fundraising for my wife, Emali's, healing journey with breast cancer. A few months ago Emali noticed a lump in her breast. She thought it might be a clogged duct as she'd just finished nursing our youngest child, Asa. It seemed normal because she had similar lumps after our other children, Kona and Hina, finished nursing. Many doctor and specialist appointments later, it was discovered she in fact had stage 2 breast cancer. Since I've known Emali, she's always been a strong and independent woman. She was the first person in my life that was health conscious and explained it to me in lay terms. As far as I can remember she's lived a natural, tree-hugger type of lifestyle. When we were first dating she was seeking help from a naturopathic doctor concerning gut issues she had. So began the candida healing journey. After being diagnosed with candida there was only one solution that aligned with Emali and that was to heal with the power of the mind and eating a fully clean diet. For well over a year Em slowly healed herself from this disease. I've never witnessed anyone take control over their own health and mind as she did. It was hard and took tremendous amounts of discipline but she did it every day without complaint. I thought, ""what an inspiration."" It was at that moment I knew we would be together for the rest of our lives. Years later we began having children and, yet again, I had the chance to witness the amazing power this woman possesses. Watching her have home-births for all 3 of our children put me in awe. She has always had this natural way of doing things that I never heard of prior to meeting her. We watch what we feed our kids; call us ""mean parents"" but there has always been very little sugar, almost no candy or soda, and home cooked meals. We even watch the type of toothpaste and deodorant we use to make sure there's no ""bad stuff."" We believe this is the right thing to do for our family and do them daily. Em has made it a point to live our lives and not boast, brag or preach to others about what we do. She never wanted anyone to feel bad about themselves based on hearing how we live. This is just our life. Simple. Her humility and grace has always been something I've admired but never talked about because, again, she just isn't like that. We try to figure things out on our own in life, not because we don't need anything from anyone but rather to not burden anyone. As I write this I'm trying to ask for help in such a way that would make Emali proud and not put-off. With all the background about the natural living, there could only be one way for Em to take on cancer and that is as natural as possible. Truly trying to heal her body to prevent this thing from ever coming back. Emali saw several local specialists and was given a plan of action. Unfortunately, with Maui's limited resources she wasn't offered a plan she felt fully comfortable with. They offer a 5-year survival plan and she has a lot more life to live. After a lot of research, we have found facilities on the mainland that offer integrative healing protocols that aim for the root cause of all imbalances in the body. This way, she can work to reverse all the disease in the body while also building her immunity for the long haul. There are a number of natural treatments given but also IPT (a low dose chemotherapy delivered through insulin). IPT aims to attack the cancer directly without killing her healthy cells at the same time. This is a 4 week treatment plan that has not been easy for her to accept. Not only does she homeschool our children but this is the longest time she will be away from the family. The funds we hope to raise will cover medical costs, travel expenses, food, and possible loss of wages. Thoughts of loving kindness and positivity are always hoped for; at this daunting moment in her life, we ask for whatever you see fit to give. Mahalo nui loa. Ua ola loko i ke aloha - love gives life within. ",21175,40000,21-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/call-for-donations-to-save-a-young-person-life,Call For Donations To Save A Young Person Life," Please kindly let me present to you the story and suffering of young Anas, who is 23 years old, and suffers from neurogenic bladder, neurogenic bowel, urinary reflux of the last stage and involuntary urination since birth. He needs a difficult surgery by a superb surgeon to eventually be able to transplant a kidney donated by his mother. Since childhood, Anas has lived a difficult daily life, as he has to perform a urinary catheter on a daily basis every four hours during the day and all hours of the night, despite the difficulty and severity of the pain, but he used to go to school and university and put the catheter tape, which causes him infections and wounds in the urethra, ending up going to the hospital emergency at the end of the day. Anas also suffers from urethral strictures due to his frequent use of urinary catheters for 12 continuous years. Anas needs a surgery to expand his bladder before having a kidney transplant. Anas and his family visited many doctors in his home country who told him that it was impossible to perform this surgery. Others told us that the surgery has no success rate and that it may lead to death, while others said that it is complicated and that it should be performed abroad. Some dcotors wrote a report urging it to be performed abroad. For 18 years, he visited doctors in search of hope, to no avail. A doctor in Jordan tried to perform an operation to expand the bladder by taking a piece of the intestines, but the operation was unsuccessful, and his right kidney was removed after that. Then Anas entered the intensive care unit in his home country, and his health condition worsened a great deal. Anas frequently went to the hospital emergency room to receive treatments, most of which were painkillers to relieve pain. One time in the emergency unit, he was mistakenly given an insulin needle intended for another patient, which led to him entering the intensive care unit again. His suffering increased two years ago, as the neurogenic bladder led to chronic kidney failure. Anas conducts kidney cleansing sessions three times a week, week after week, at a rate of four hours for each session. Anas' life has become very difficult, as there is a permanent catheter tube inside his chest that extends to his right atrium so that he can perform dialysis through it. It is forbidden for him to lift anything weighing more than 1 kilogram and he cannot do any form of sports and he needs help from people around him. He cannot carry the bag alone for fear of bone fractures. Patients with kidney failure suffer from osteoporosis and easily ruptured arteries. Anas lives with a strict diet that is low in potassium, phosphorous, calcium, sodium and protein, and he is forbidden to drink more than one liter of water per day, and this leads to constipation and difficulty in passing stool and he cannot urinate when he goes to the bathroom. Since childhood, Anas spends most of his time in hospitals to receive treatments and perform dialysis sessions. He spends more time in hospitals than at home. When Anas was diagnosed with kidney failure, he was a university student, attending lectures and then went to the hospital for dialysis sessions and sometimes vice versa. It was arduous and exhausting for him to do this weekly, sometimes arriving late due to his deteriorating health, exhaustion and pain from the dialysis that could last for days. Patients with kidney failure lose balance and focus and find it difficult to sleep, as breathing is interrupted during sleep and accompanied by pain throughout the night, which made the road more difficult for Anas. He was not able to travel between colleges within the university to attend his lectures or even climb the stairs sometimes. He was doing exams after dialysis, barely holding a pen in his hand. Many of his university professors did not understand Anas' health condition and did not agree for him to retake the exams that he missed due to the cleansing sessions. It was such a strong shock for him that he couldn't believe what had happened and then continued to struggle with frustration and depression for a while. However, Anas stood up again and decided to fight the disease. Despite the long and difficult path, he completed it to the end and received his bachelor's degree in computer science from the university with distinction! Anas was happy with what he accomplished, but what happened next was the most difficult. After his graduation, Anas began conducting interviews and exams like any new graduate to find a job. He passed the job exams and dazzled those interviews. His health conditions and his need for dialysis were not taken into account by the company owners and they rejected him. This happened every time he applied for a job. Thus, he has given up looking for a job. And here he began to feel weak and helpless, as he could not get a job and could not complete his master's and doctoral studies as he had aspired. Anas felt very sad in his heart that he was an ineffective and unproductive person in life and not even able to go out with his friends and colleagues. After he went through psychological and physical pains, Anas and his family decided to perform a kidney transplant abroad to save his life. The tests matched between Anas and his mother wants to donate her kidney to him as soon as possible. He recently had a consultation at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem, and the doctor told him that he needed to undergo an operation to expand the bladder from the intestines first, then a kidney transplant comes second. The doctor said that the operation to expand the bladder is a rare operation, but its success rate is one hundred percent as it requires a full surgical day and ten days in the hospital at least. The surgery is done by cutting a supplementary bladder 20 cm long from the intestine and installing it with the original bladder to inflate Its size is with the reconstruction of a new urinary tract in the abdomen. This surgery is a complex, difficult and long process that requires a full surgical day, and it is preferable to perform it outside Jordan, and this was confirmed by many doctors. Hope returned again to Anas after hearing these words. The surprise was when Anas and his family received the surgery cost estimate from the Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem, as they could not afford this cost of this surgical procedure. Anas’ father has the Alzheimer’s disease and has been unemployed, and Anas was the eldest among his brothers. There is no one working in his family. Three months after the bladder enlargement procedure, Anas will be able to have a kidney transplant as donated by his mother, go about his normal life activities, study for a master's degree, and walk towards his shattered dreams and ambitions. I ask everyone to support Anas and his family in these trying times. He's still young and has so many things to do that he can't do it without your help. Despite the high cost of the operation, it will bring him back to life again. Any amount of donation would be greatly appreciated and would go a long way in saving the life of someone who has been robbed of hope and usual life. The amount required to perform the surgery in the Hadassah Hospital is $68,974. Attached are photos of the costs from the Hadassah Hospital and the doctor's summary of the surgery. Your donations will save Anas’s life and soul and it would greatly be appreciated. We encourage you to donate if you can. If you can't, please share it with family, friends and groups so we can save his life. اسمحوا لي ان اعرض عليكم قصة و معاناة الشاب أنس و عمره 23 عاما , حيث انه يعاني من مثانة عصبية و امعاء عصبية و ارتداد بالبول من الدرجة الاخيرة و تبول اللاارادي منذ الولادة ولا يوجد حل لها في البلد الذي يقيم بها والان يجري جلسات غسيل الكلى و هو بحاجة الى جراحة صعبة ليتمكن بعدها من زراعة الكلى من والدته. يعيش أنس منذ صغره حياة يومية صعبة فهو مضطر الى القيام بالقسطرة البولية بشكل يومي كل اربع ساعات في النهار و طوال ساعات الليل رغم صعوبتها و شدة ألمها الا انه كان يذهب الى المدرسة و الجامعة و هو يضع البربيش الخاص بالقسطرة مما يسبب له الالتهابات و الجروح في الاحليل فينتهي به المطاف بالذهاب الى طوارئ المستشفى في نهاية اليوم. أصيب أنس بتضيق في الأحليل من كثرة استخدامه للقسطرة البولية على مدار 12 سنة متواصلة. يحتاج أنس الى اجراء جراحة لتوسيع المثانة. زار أنس و عائلته العديد من الاطباء اخبروه باستحالة اجرائهم هذه الجراحة و اخرون اخبرونا انه لا يوجد نسبة نجاح و انها قد تؤدي الى الوفاة و غيرهم قال انها معقدة و يجب اجرائها بالخارج و كتب البعض تقرير يحث على اجرائها بالخارج. مدة 18 سنة وهو يزور الاطباء باحثا عن امل دون جدوى. حاول احد الاطباء بالاردن اجراء عملية توسيع المثانة باخذ قطعة من الامعاء لكن العملية بائت بالفشل و استئصلت كليته اليمنى اثر ذلك و دخل أنس في وحدة العناية الحثيثة و ساءت حالته الصحية كثيرا. كان يتردد أنس بشكل متكرر على طوارئ مستشفى لتلقي العلاجات كان اغلبها مسكنات لتخفيف آلامه. احد المرات في الطوارئ تم اعطائه بالخطأ ابرة انسولين خاصة بمريض اخر مما ادى الى دخوله وحدة العناية الحثيثة مرة اخرى. ازدادت معاناته قبل عامين حيث ادت المثانة العصبية الى فشل كلوي مزمن. يجري أنس جلسات الغسيل ثلاث مرت اسبوعيا يوم بعد يوم بمعدل اربع ساعات كل جلسة. اصبحت حياة أنس صعبة للغاية فيوجد بربيش داخل صدره يمتد الى قلبه ليتمكن من اجراء غسيل الكلى من خلاله. يمنع عليه رفع اي شيء يزيد وزنه عن 1 كيلوغرام و لا يمكنه ممارسة اي شكل من اشكال الرياضة و هو بحاجة الى المساعدة من الاشخاص حوله فلا يمكنه حمل الحقيبة وحده خشية حدوث كسور في العظام فمرضى الفشل الكلوي يصيبهم هشاشة العظام و تمزق الشرايين بسهولة. يعيش أنس مع نظام غذائي قاصي قليل البوتاسيوم و الفسفور و الكاسيوم و الصوديوم و البروتين و يمنع شربه لاكثر من لتر واحد من الماء في اليوم و هذا يؤدي الى امساك و صعوبة في الاخراج ولا يمكنه التبول عند ذهابه الى الحمام. يقضي أنس منذ الطفولة معظم اوقاته في المستشفيات لتلقي العلاجات و اجراء جلسات الغسيل الكلى .يمضي وقتا بالمستشفى اكثر من منزله. عندما اصيب أنس بالفشل الكلوي كان طالب في الجامعة و كان يحضر محاضرات ثم يذهب الى المستشفى ليقوم باجراء جلسات الغسيل و احيانا العكس. كان الامر شاق و مرهق له, احيانا كان يصل متاخر بسبب تراجع صحته و ما يسببه غسيل الكلى من تعب و آلام قد تمتد الى ايام. يفقد مريض الفشل الكلوي التوازن و التركيز و يواجهون صعوبة في النوم حيث ينقطع النفس اثناء النوم و يصاحبها آلام طوال الليل وهذا ما زاد صعوبة الطريق على أنس . و لم يكن بمقدروه التنقل بين الكليات البعيدة عن بعضها داخل الجامعة لحضور محاضراته او حتى صعود الدرج بعض الاحيان. كان يذهب للتقدم للامتحانات بعد اجراء غسيل الكلى بالكاد كان بمقدوره امساك القلم بيده. لم يتفهم الكثير من اساتذته بالجامعة وضع أنس الصحي و لم يوافقوا على اعادة الامتحانات التي كان يتغيب عنها بسبب جلسات الغسيل. كانت صدمة قوية بالنسبة له لم يصدق ما حدث و عانى بعدها من الاحباط والاكتئاب لفترة. وقف أنس من جديد و قرر مقارعة المرض. بالرغم من طول الطريق و صعوبته الا انه أكمله الى النهاية و حصل على شهادة البكالوريوس من الجامعة بمعدل أمتياز. سعد أنس بما أنجزه لكن ما حدث بعدها كان هو الاصعب. بعد تخرجه بدء أنس باجراء المقابلات و الامتحانات مثل اي حديث تخرج و كان ينجح بالامتحانات و يبهر المقابلين له,لم تتم مراعاة ظروفه الصحية واحتياجه للغسيل الكلوي من قبل اصحاب الشركات و قاموا برفضه , كان يحدث هذا في كل مرة تقدم فيها الى وظيفة. الى ان اصابه اليأس. هنا بدء يشعر بالضعف و العجز حيث لا وظيفة يمكنه الحصول عليها ولا يمكنه اكمال دراسة الماجيستر و الدكتوراة كما كان يطمح. شعر أنس بحسرة في قلبه و حزن و بانه شخص غير فعال و غير منتج في الحياة حتى انه لم يكن قادر على الخروج برفقة اصدقائه و زملائه ما عاد جسده كما كان هذا كله ادى الى شعوره بالوحدة. بعد ما مر به من آلام نفسية و جسدية, قرر أنس و عائلته اجراء زراعة الكلى لانقاذ حياة أنس , تطابقت الفحوصات بين أنس و والدته فأرادت التبرع بكليتها له باسرع وقت ممكن. اجرى مؤخرا استشارة لدى مستشفى هداسا في القدس و اخبره الطبيب بانه بحاجة الى اجراء عملية توسيع المثانة من الامعاء اولا ثم زراعة الكلى . قال الطبيب ان عملبة توسيع المثانة هي عملية نادرة لكن نسبة نجاحها لديهم هي مئة بالمئة الا انها تحتاج الى يوم جراحي كامل و عشر ايام في المستشفى على الاقل, تتم عملية توسيع المثانة بقص قطعة طولها 20 سم من الامعاء و تركيبها مع المثانة لتضخيم حجمها مع اعادة بناء مجرى بولي جديد في البطن و هي عملية معقدة و صعبة و طويلة تحتاج الى يوم جراحي كامل و يفضل اجرائها خارج الاردن و هذا ما اكده الكثير من الاطباء. عاد الامل من جديد بعد سماعهم لهذا الكلام كانت المفاجأة عند استلامهم عرض السعر من المستشفى حيث لا يمكنهم تسديد تكاليف الاجراء الجراحي فان والده مصاب بالزهايمر و بدون عمل و أنس هو الاكبر بين اخوته , لايوجد من يعمل في اسرتهم. بعد ثلاثة أشهر من إجراء توسيع المثانة ، سيتمكن أنس من إجراء عملية زرع كلية ، وممارسة أنشطة حياته يشكل طبيعي ، والدراسة للحصول على درجة الماجستير ، والسير نحو أحلامه وطموحاته المحطمة. أطلب من الجميع دعم أنس وعائلته في هذه الأوقات العصيبة التي يمرون بها. لا يزال صغيراً ولديه الكثير من الأشياء ليفعلها ولا يمكنه فعل ذلك بدون مساعدتك. على الرغم من التكلفة العالية للعملية ، إلا أنها ستعيده إلى الحياة مرة أخرى. أي مبلغ من التبرعات سيكون موضع تقدير كبير وسيقطع شوطًا طويلاً في إنقاذ حياة شخص سلب الأمل. المبلغ المطلوب لإجراء الجراحة هو 68974 دولارًا. مرفق صور للتكاليف من قبل مستشفى هداسا و ملخص الطبيب للعملية الجراحية. تبرعاتك ستنقذ حياته و روحه. نحن نشجعك على التبرع إذا استطعت. إذا كنت لا تستطيع ، يرجى التفضل بمشاركتها مع العائلة والأصدقاء والمجموعات حتى نتمكن من إنقاذ حياته.

Our Dad, Mike Taylor, was diagnosed with lung cancer recently. We began this journey with what we thought was a hornet sting that possibly caused some sort of nerve damage. That would have been a much simpler problem. It turned out to be a tumor in his leg, making him unable to walk or stand well. We've recently learned that it is in fact, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that has spread, to be specific. This is an aggressive disease, and we are still exploring what Dad's treatment options are. Due to the effects of this illness, he has been unable to work since mid-August. His wife Trudy has also recently taken leave from her job as well, to care for Dad full time. This leaves them with a very limited income. We, as his kids, are hoping to spread the word and get them some help with bills and medical expenses that have quickly built up, and will likely continue to build up for the weeks and months to come. Whether you give a prayer, a caring word of encouragement, or a donation - know that you are contributing to this fight with us, and please know you have our family's deepest, sincere gratitude. We love our Dad, and we want to do anything we can to get him any relief we can, during this difficult time. We can't make the cancer go away overnight - as much as we all wish we could. But with your help, we can hopefully help reduce the burden on his and Trudy's shoulders a bit. If you know our Dad at all, you're probably missing him at the first Black Hawk games. Or wondering why he isn't at hockey practice with his grandsons so far this season. You may have been into Community Motors to get your car serviced, and noticed his smiling face is missing. We are hoping he'll be back in all of those places very soon, and back to enjoying time with his kids and grandkids. Until then, please continue to keep him in your thoughts and prayers.

Upfront disclosure, im not a writter or the best with words, its emotionally painful to even write this so I'll do my best to highlight the situation and this families needs. Jason Soto, pictured is one of the most selfless people I have ever known.  He would drop anything to help anyone, give the shirt off his back.  A loving father and devoted husband.  Its hard to show in just one picture this man's character. Jason worked a full time job and commuted for three hours each day.  The job sucked.  Over worked and far underpaid.  He and his wife also have a small hobby farm raising a couple cows and chickens.  He would work full time, then work the small farm, and support his children at sporting events, etc.  and also help his local community.  This man worked himself sick trying to provide a good life. Jason and his family have had such a rough year.  It started with the loss of his father followed by the loss of his mother just six months the later.  Now Jason himself is in the hospital fighting for his life, trying to recover from covid pneumonia.  Jason, as selfless as he is, would want to kick my butt for doing this, but its the only way I could think to help him and his family.  Jason,  I pray you wake up, read this,, and hate me for this and know that I love you like a brother.   The past three weeks in the hospital have been rough, it seems everyday is a new discovery of more bad news.  From blood clots to organ failure.  Jason is still fighting though.  Theres no light in the tunnel just yet but we pray hard everyday that he will pull through and recover. I can't even begin to imagine the emotion his wife is dealing with.  While trying to get short term disability insurance, she was told he will get just a third of his pay and then be responsible for sending back the amount due for insurance. Jason's wife Jen has been such a rock foundation for him.  By his side everyday, doing everything in her power to keep the farm going, the house functional, being the courageous loving parent to their children, all while working a part time job at the local school.  Dealing with the tragic emotions then faced with making extremely difficult decisions regarding treatment options. As for now Jason is still hanging on and continuing to fight and is getting the best treatment possible only God knows how much is going to cost. Anything you can contribute is something that will hopefully ease the stress on Jen and the family.  This situation is not something anyone could ever plan for and I know that together as a community we can help this amazing family. Thank you, Joel ",6355,50000,7 days

Our little girl Ipek was diagnosed with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or DIPG on 09/06/2021. Just a few ours before her diagnoses her parents believed her to be a very healthy and lucky girl. She finished 1st grade at the top of her class and on that day she was supposed to start second grade. Instead of going to school her parents took her to the hospital due to severe nausea. The day before they noticed a change in her smile but they thought she was doing it on purpose to be funny. Still they thought to mention it to the doctor and this is how everything started… Following days her parents took her to see several specialists, at the main oncology hospitals in Istanbul. Biopsy was performed at 09/13/2021 and H3K27M Mutation is determined, confirming the diagnosis as DIPG. DIPG is highly aggressive, cannot be operated and very difficult to treat. It is located in an area of the brainstem, which controls many of the body's most vital functions such as breathing, blood pressure, and heart rate, and every day activities such as walking and swallowing. It also affects the nerves and muscles that help us see, hear, and talk. Treatment is very difficult, since it cannot be operated and does not respond to known chemo treatments. Only options are radiation therapy to help with the symptoms and clinical trials. Ipek is currently receiving radiation treatment, that will be completed on October 27th, 2021. After that our only hope is clinical trials. Our girl İpek is only 7 years old. Meaning of her name is “silk” and she is as soft, beautiful and precious as silk. She likes to swim, read, climb and play with her little brother. She loves animals, especially dogs. We are trying to do all we can to support Ipek and her family. Her parents are academicians, they teach at a university in Turkey and help other children everyday but they cannot afford the expenses involved with the clinical trials. Her mommy and daddy are working night and day trying the find and provide the best possible treatment options for Ipek, while trying to spend time with her and her 2 yo little brother. Please consider donation so that while caring for their two children in this very difficult time this family does not need to worry about the financial burden of it, at least not only by themselves. If we can help a little they can breath a little. Any excess donations will go to fund to find a treatment for this horrible childhood cancer. Please send love and good thoughts/prayers for this family of four!! ",2826,50000,7 days

Nevelyn was born with middle ear conductive hearing loss and has 70% hearing loss in both ears. She got through her toddler years mainly lip reading. Nevelyn is currently using a pair of loaner hearing aids from her audiologist and it makes a world of difference for her but she now needs her very own pair. Unfortunately we are insured through Blue Cross and they cover 0% for hearing. With no luck with state funding and applications to grants yet I’m taking advice from family members and am here to ask for some help paying for her hearing aids. I never would have imagined being in this situation where something medically necessary for my child would be such a set back for our family. My husband works full time and I’ve been at home with the children for 7 years. The upfront cost of $8,000 for the hearing aids plus appointments and tests is more than we can afford right now. Any and all help is deeply appreciated. We would be more than blessed to even make a dent in the cost with this fundraiser. Thank you ❤️ The PricesI wanted to edit to add that we have applied for several grants but none have been approved. With that said if any do get approved we will lower the total goal by what ever amount is granted. We would still love your suggestions on foundations because we may have not tried them yet!!!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/eitans-epilepsy-surgery,Eitan's Epilepsy Surgery,"Just after our son Eitan turned one, we discovered that he has a seizure disorder caused by Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). TSC, a rare genetic disease with no known cure, causes benign tumors to grow throughout organs in the body - primarily in the eyes, heart, kidneys, skin, lungs, and brain. The aspects of TSC that most strongly impact quality of life are generally associated with the brain: seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism. Now at age 11, with a trail of failed medications behind him, Eitan’s epilepsy is “intractable” or “drug-resistant,” meaning that medication alone will not bring him long term seizure control. After a new seizure type emerged this summer, causing a life-threatening status seizure, we began an extensive process with the neurosurgery team at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital to determine Eitan’s best path forward. The process begins on October 29th with extensive testing for several weeks as world experts in TSC study and analyze how seizures work in Eitan’s brain to determine if he is a candidate for epilepsy surgery. This means that he will be in and out of the hospital in another state for the foreseeable future. It means that our family will be separated - with Leah and Eitan in Cincinnati and Mike at home in Carlisle with Eitan’s three siblings - as we try to maintain some semblance of normalcy for our other kids. We know that folks want to help and support Eitan and we think this GoFundMe is the least complicated, most useful way to send a gift right now. While we have excellent medical insurance, there are many expenses associated with this journey that are not covered. Eitan's Special Needs Trust, The Eitan S. Levinstein Wholly Discretionary Trust, can be used to cover these costs, but we're concerned about exhausting the trust this early in his life. This GoFundMe is designed to add additional funds to the trust to be used for expenses such as transportation, lodging, food, a seizure detection watch, Lego sets to occupy his time between evaluations, and to support his potential recovery from surgery or surgeries. In deep gratitude,Mike and Leah",9747,7500,21-Oct-21

Dear Community, On September 1, 2021, Kelli McGhee experienced shortness of breath and was admitted to ICU with Covid-19. Kelli was quickly sedated and intubated, and since, has experienced complications. As of September 28, Kelli is still in critical condition in the ICU.  She remains sedated and the prognosis is unclear. Kelli is a Cocoa High School alumnus (Class of 1981) who worked on various contracts at Cape Canaveral AFS and Kennedy Space Center, baked McTreats (dog treats) for many local dogs, and bartended at several establishments in Brevard County, FL. She has a love for animals, sharing her homecooked meals, shooting firearms, and riding her Harley. She has a heart of gold and would give the shirt off her back for anyone in need.  For those who are lucky to know Kelli, she is a VERY independent woman who (to our knowledge) has never asked anyone for help. Kelli’s mother and long-time Brevard resident, Lillie, now faces the task of managing and maintaining Kelli’s residence, paying her monthly bills, and caring for Kelli’s beloved Rottweiler, MJ. Although this may sound simple to some, it is not easy for her mother to handle, along with the emotional stress she endures daily. Kelli has always prepared meals for her mother and helped her manage her home. Now, the tables have turned, and it is a financial hardship and emotionally stressful on her mother, to say the least.  While Kelli’s path forward is unclear, we ask for your support to help cover expenses related to managing Kelli’s home, dog, insurance premiums, utilities, and medical expenses. Funds in the GoFundMe account are only accessible by her younger brother, Michael McGhee (Administrator of funds) and mother. Additionally, we ask for all the positive vibes and prayers for Kelli’s healing and the family’s strength.  Please feel free to share this request with the community on social media, within your place of business, affiliated clubs/organizations, and family/friends. If there are any other ways you would like to donate or have any questions, please contact us directly through the GoFundMe link. Thank you, in advance, for any support you provide.

I'm 36 years old and currently living in Spartanburg, South Carolina for about 6 years now. Originally from San Juan, Puerto Rico.  Was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect in February of 2019 as I was taking a physical exam for a new job. Suffering from atrial fibrillation and mitral valve regurgitation. As a result, I'm not able to do much in order to prevent having a stroke. Currently working for about two years as a pizza delivery driver to help with my living expenses to some extent.  Got a valve replacement surgery scheduled for November 16th, 2021 and won't be able to work for around 2-3 months after the procedure is done. Got no nearby friends or family around for help and just as recent as September of this year, I lost my father to leukemia, which makes things much harder; not to mention the current pandemic we're all trying to endure.  Hospital's estimated cost for the surgery is rounded up to $330K and are asking for $1500 up front in order for them to move further with the surgery in November. Also need to cover living expenses throughout my recovery period so I can get back on my feet and continue with my life's goals.  Graduated in 2019 from Sherman College of Chiropractic and want to feel better so I can find a better job, finish my board exams and obtain my doctor's license in order to finally start helping people out there. But first, need to get this surgery out of the way so I can then in time begin to pay it forward.  I thank you in advance and hopefully things change for the better not just for me, but for everyone else very soon. Stay safe.  ",1274,400000,3 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/jolynn-rick-christian-need-our-help,Jolynn & Rick Christian need our help,"Chrissy Ihfe is organizing this fundraiser. As some of you may know, September 16th our world was turned upside down when our mom, Jolynn Christian, received the news no one wants to hear. CANCER. The doctors found a tumor on her bladder and scheduled surgery to remove the tumor on Oct. 8th. Unfortunately, we received the news that the tumor spread and she will not only require chemo therapy, but also the removal of her bladder. Considering our mom has been extremely healthy, this is a complete shock to our family. Our mom is a saint. She has worked as a CNA in a nursing home for 34 years taking care of others’ family members. She had her eyes on partly retiring in February of 2022. She says partly because she is worried she will miss her residents too much. She has been married for almost 49 years to her high school sweetheart and takes care of their hobby farm and horses. She is the main full time caregiver of our father, Rick Christian, who has been in remission for over 10 years himself and battles with diabetes. She is a wonderful mom who has always puts her children first. Growing up, at times she worked 3 jobs and managed to never miss any of our sporting events, band or choir concerts, 4H horse shows, rodeos, school events, parent-teacher conferences, etc. She’s literally all 3 of our biggest cheerleader. She is the true definition of Wonder Woman. She is a grandmother of 7 beautiful grandchildren who love her dearly. The list can go on of her amazing talents, but most importantly she needs our help. She has always given to others her entire life and has never once asked for anything for herself. It’s time for her to get a break. With our dad not able to drive or take care of the farm, her being his only caregiver, the upcoming surgeries and chemo appointments, and all the expenses that will come her way she has a lot of worries and stress that she shouldn’t have to worry about. Not to mention the unplanned time off of work is going to cause some hardships for both of them. If you can help in any way, they would greatly appreciate it. The money would go directly to medical bills, travel and hotel expenses during her treatments, potential assistance my dad will need in the absence of our mom’s help, and the burden of the time off of work. If you aren’t able to help please say a prayer for our family and share with a friend. Thank you, Rick and Jolynn’s children Theresa Briggs Ricky Christian Chrissy Ihfe ",7715,40000,12-Oct-21

Jenna LOOOVES hiking, and she loves sharing it with anyone that would join her. It is a ministry of sorts for connecting to others, nature, and the Lord. A few days back, Jenna was out for a hike, as she has done hundreds and hundreds of times over the last decade, and took a horrendous tumble which resulted in a complete break of her femur. She waited over an hour for paramedics to get to her. So badass. Such a fighter. Jenna has already undergone one surgery, and she will be having another on the 27th of October at 9:45am to place lots of pins and plates in her femur. The healing and recovery process are not fully known quite yet, but Jenna will be unable to work- unable to get paid- for an extensive period of time. Let's bless this amazing powerhouse of a woman by allowing her to focus on rest and recovery instead of money, normal life bills, and the piling medical bills that no amount of insurance could cover. The money being raised is going towards:- Rent- Medical Bills - Post op procedures- PT This woman deserves to be cared for in a way that spreads the light and love of Jesus as she has done for so many. She is one that loves sacrificially, and forgives even the worst- I know this firsthand:) Please join me in fighting for Jenna's recovery and well-being. We will be posting updates as they come.

In August of 2021 Roz was diagnosed with Glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is an aggressive type of brain cancer. Glioblastoma can be very difficult to treat but our girl is up to the challenge.

Procedures and treatments have already begun and the sooner we can have funds to help, the more we can relieve the stress on Roz and her family.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-irene-with-hospital-rehab-facility-bills,Help Irene with Hospital & Rehab Facility Bills,"Team fundraiserAngela Jenks and 0 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Joe Peterson. Hello there! My name is Angela and I am starting a fundraiser for Irene Peterson. I met the Peterson family at Zaza Ink, where I am currently a tattoo apprentice. At Zaza Ink, we are a close knit crew so we are all devastated to not have Irene at the shop with us everyday. Irene became very ill in the beginning of September with a severe case of Covid-19. She was emitted into a local hospital and after a few days was put on a ventilator. After two weeks in the local hospital, she still showed signs of a steady decline. She had to be life flighted to a different facility, where they could further assist her. When she arrived at Rhode Island Hospital, she was put on the Ecmo machine, which is oxygenating her blood and giving her lungs a chance to rest and heal. Now, four weeks later, she is finally starting to show slight improvements. We are unsure of what her timeline for recovery on the Ecmo machine will be but we remain optimistic that she will continue to progress and hopefully avoid any major setbacks. Once Irene is off of the Ecmo Life Support, She will need to be placed in a long term rehab facility for her continual progression. Irene is a beautiful soul , wife and mother of two sons and has been a foster parent for twelve years. She donates her time to help with various events for LGBTQ and is an avid giver to charities. Everyone who knows Irene will say she is one of the most strong, kind and selfless people there is so I am asking that we come together to help her and her family through this hard time they are facing.

Katie is our baby girl, baby sister, love of our life, #38s biggest fan, aunt KT, BEST friend, zeus’s mom, fav sister in law, always down for a good time, fisher woman- we can go on and on. Katie’s zest for life and enjoying it is contagious. After not feeling well for a month or so and some unexplained bruising Katie took herself in for a check up and to have labs run. Results came back later that day from her Dr that her levels were dangerously low and she needed to go immediately to be admitted for a blood transfusion. Once admitted oncology quickly came in to say this could be something else. The next day we learned her diagnosis. Katie has aggressive B Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). Katies team of doctors have decided that a vigorous chemotherapy schedule is the best defense along with a future bone marrow transplant. We know we have a long road ahead but we plan on tackling it with unwavering optimism and welcome all thoughts, prayers, cheers and well wishes. We ask you to join team Katie Strong and to show your support in any way you can! If you know us McNallys, we’ve got spunk and grit. We don’t shy away from a challenge.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-support-clay-broussard,Help us support Clay Broussard," Hello. We come to you as friends and bandmates of our beloved Clay Broussard. In early September Clay suffered a series of TIAs  or mini-strokes.  He lost the use of his right side for a time and was hospitalized for several days.  Thankfully, Clay’s mind is fully intact, but his general physical functioning is significantly impacted.  Recovery is going to take time.  Clay also suffers from “end-stage renal disease,” and is undergoing dialysis. Unfortunately, his treatment has been beset by complications and has not gone well.  While the search for a transplant has been unsuccessful thus far, we continue to hope a match will be found.  The Broussards are facing dire financial straits due to mounting medical bills.  Clay has continued to do online teaching and tutoring; amazingly, he is already back to grading papers, even though the process is painfully slow and taxing. Clay has touched many throughout the years; as a professor and academic dean, a producer of online music programming, a long-running music columnist, and a successful producer of electronic dance music. Moreover, he has been a legend in the southeastern music scene; a mentor, friend, and reliable sounding board for so many of us.  We ask anyone who’s been touched by Clay to give what you can to help, and to keep him in your prayers.  Thank you very much! ",2610,15000,3 days

Hi, my name is Matt O'Groske and my best friend from my high school days has an 11 year old son that was diagnosed with T-cell leukemia on August 28th.  Magnus Rudlong is in the 5th grade at LeRoy-Ostrander Elementary School.  He loves the outdoors, playing video games, animals, and ia an amazing big brother to 9 year old Soren.  Magnus' illness come on suddenly and aggressively.  Since the diagnosis, he has started on chemotherapy and unfortunately has had numerous setbacks and conplications.  He is currently at Mayo clinic in the cardiac ICU.  His parents Joel and Sara are at the Ronald McDonald house, and his brother Soren is with his grandparents.  This is incredibly hard on this tight knit family, and there is still a long hard road ahead.  Neither himself or his brother are able to go to school due to the possibility of introducing viruses and bacteria to an already compromised immune system. There are a lot of treatments, as well as many other expenses that accompany a long recovery like this. (Hotel stays, meals, loss of work, medical expenses, etc, etc).

https://www.gofundme.com/f/please-help-pay-for-jessicas-medical-expenses,Help support Jessica & family (medical expenses)," Hello again to Jessica’s family and friends… The time has come to reach out and ask for some tangible help for Jessica and her family. For those of you who haven’t been following along on CaringBridge (https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/jessicaedgar) a quick recap – Jessica had a scheduled, “routine” hysterectomy in late-May. She did well with surgery and was discharged soon after. About a week later, she was back in the hospital where we have witnessed her steady decline with a few hopeful steps in the right direction over the past several months. She has had multiple surgeries, re-admissions for complications/infections, and placements of an ileostomy, tracheostomy, feeding tube, and central lines. She has been in the care of Select Specialty Hospital with periodic re-admissions to the ICU at St. Joe’s since August and even now is struggling with incapacitation due to another respiratory infection and continued wide-spread swelling. Her level of care (ICU, respiratory rehab) in the “time of COVID” has limited visitors and not allowed for delivery of flowers and the like since way back when she was transferred to Mayo in July. Additionally, every time she’s re-admitted, her belongings are bagged up and sent home again. I know, since the beginning, everyone has been asking how they could help and to pass along your thoughts/prayers to Jessica and her family. The CaringBridge messages, cards, and other well-wishes have been very appreciated and hopefully are providing Jessica the needed mental boost to continue fighting thru this. But, now, the bills are starting to come in, and some financial support will go a very long way to help alleviate that unnecessary burden for the family (who, I should add, really hate to ask/accept this, for what it’s worth). So far, there’s the $1,500 original surgery (hysterectomy) bill, the $5,200 anesthesia bill, the $7,500 Airvac bill, and many more to come. Jessica’s employer-sponsored health insurance will continue thru the end of this year, and her brother is current working on getting SSI-D in place for the long term, since it’s clear that this fight won’t be over any time soon. All funds raised will go directly towards Jessica’s medical expenses with any residual funds going towards supporting her longer term needs or refunded back to givers, if felt to be unnecessary (per family’s wishes). We know that Jessica has touched so many lives over the years and has been a wonderful friend and ally to countless folks. We ask that you consider returning that favor, and if you’re not able to give, please take a moment to share this page, and continue sending those thoughts and prayers her way. Thank you for your consideration. For anyone preferring to send an “offline” donation, please mail checks to: Jonathan Edgar 5728 West Cannon Drive Glendale, AZ 85302 *For those who don’t know me personally, I have known Jessica since my days at CRS - Orthopedics (when it was still part of St. Joe’s). She was one of my preceptors during my PNP program (way back in 2009). I was hired soon after I graduated (in 2010), and even though I only worked at CRS for about a year, we really clicked and have been good friends since. We’ve been alongside each other for so many ups and downs over the years, even if we weren’t always in the same town or even same state. I love her like the sister I never had, and it kills me (and my husband who also adores her) to see her continue to suffer from afar (my family and I now live in Oregon). It brings me comfort, however, to know that her brother and sons are nearby and that she is so loved by all of you. Thank you. As always, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me directly if you have any questions. ",6721,20000,20-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-syrus-recover,Help Syrus recover,"Lynn Vera is organizing this fundraiser. Hello my name is Lynn and my 4 year old nephew Syrus is having a brain surgery this Friday 10/22 at UCSF for his two brain avms. The drs are doing this a year earlier than age recommended due to his avms now being dilated. My family has no choice, but to go through with the procedure now to prevent the avms from rupturing and causing any severe or fatal outcomes. Syrus is having a surgery called gamma knife radio-surgery which is where they bolt a head piece to his scalp and do a focal point radiation treatment to target the avms. We are scared, but we know that we are left with no other option right now besides surgery. If this surgery doesn’t work then he will have a surgery to remove the avms which would cause permanent damage to his brain since the avms are located in part of the brain that controls movement of the body and other important sensors he needs to function independently.  I decided to create a go fund me account with hopes of easing some of the financial burden my brother and my nephews mom will have with having to take time off of work to care for my nephew. Unfortunately we don’t know how long it will take for Syrus to heal and we don’t know what the side effects of the powerful radiation will be. We won’t even know until 1-2 years later if this surgery was a success.  They will have many trips back and forth to UCSF for follow ups, mris, etc. No donation is too small and if you could please say a prayer for my beautiful nephew Syrus that would mean the world to us.

Just recently, we found out some devastating news. He was diagnosed with stage four liver cancer, and has several tumors on his liver, including one dangerously large one. Due to the aggressive sizing of that tumor, and the amount of arteries connected to it, surgery is not an option. Exposing the tumor to oxygen will only cause it to grow faster. As of right now, the only option doctors have is to try to prevent further growth. He is a father not only to me, but to my three sisters and one brother. Apart from us, he is loved by so many others. Not just the by rest of our family, but by his friends and colleagues. Michael is the type of person who always makes sure everyone around him his having a good time and is taken care of. We hope that with your help, and these treatments, he will be able to continue enjoying those moments. All this being said, Michael currently lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with his wife and youngest daughter, Katie. Katie is only three years old. I am currently residing in Alabama, and the rest of my siblings live in Florida. Michael is very weak and cannot work during this time. For these reasons, any donations made will go directly towards aiding in our travels to see him, as well as any medical and daily expenses such as groceries, childcare, etc. Any and everything will be greatly appreciated, even if it is just a share of this post and keeping our family in your prayers. We would all like to thank you in advance for helping us during this tough time. With love, The Pho family ",3830,5000,4 days

Mia’s Army:  The Zinn family is in great need of your support. On September 2, 2021, 15 year-old Mia Zinn was diagnosed with an aggressive and rare form of childhood cancer called Ewing’s Sarcoma. In that week before her 16th birthday this strong, brave girl learned that the pain she had been dealing with was not a dance injury and that her life was about to change dramatically. Her parents, Chris and Aubrey, have watched their unbelievable daughter take in all of the information—including that the cancer has already spread to her lung, femur, sacrum, and arm—and state, “I am strong. I am a fighter.” So they have to be, too. This is war. The war has already been physically and emotionally draining, but the Zinns are optimistic and determined, believing that positivity breeds positive outcomes. Anyone who knows them, loves them. We hope anyone who reads this story will want to help; they deserve an army behind them as they fight this cancer alongside their extraordinary daughter. Unfortunately, cancer and finances co-exist in an ugly, cruel reality.  The money that is raised here will directly help with the Zinns’ financial burden: costs of co-pays, medicine, gas, parking, work-time lost. These stack up so quickly. There might come a day when the insurance won’t cover a procedure or something experimental that is needed.  The Zinns have been through several back surgeries for Chris and open-heart surgery for Aubrey, and they have never asked for help. But when it comes to their children, they will stop at nothing. Any funds raised that are not needed for Mia’s medical expenses will be donated to childhood cancer research. Please join us in prayer and contribution for Mia and for the Zinns…for she is a rare and beautiful soul indeed.  Ewing’s Sarcoma picked the wrong girl to mess with.  We have our orders and we are marching forward!!! Please join #Mia’sArmy! ",95964,100000,27-Sep-21

This is never an easy email to write and our hearts hurt for Oscar and his family as they navigate the next stages of healing and pending pathology reports. With much unknown, there is one thing I know for sure and that is Aligned is a comprised of some of the most giving and caring team members around. If you are able, we have set up a GoFundMe to help with meals, medical expenses and relief while he is recovering. I know Oscar, Muriel and his two young boys would also appreciate your thoughts and prayers too! Below is the email from his sweet wife, Muriel: Oscar Ortiz is a hardworking, loving husband and father whose world was recently turned upside down. On October 20, after two nights of excruciating back pain, Oscar was admitted to Methodist Richardson Medical Center and initially diagnosed with a blood clot in his left lung. Then came news of a scary, unexpected finding: a large mass in his abdomen, likely cancerous, that could be affecting various organs. Immediately following the news, Oscar experienced what’s called a vagal response and was without a heartbeat for several seconds. At that time, the doctors’ main priority was the removal of the mass, but now had to consider his heart and lung complications. After a second vagal response episode and loss of heartbeat the following day, the doctors determined it would be best to put in a temporary pacemaker prior to the surgery as a preventative measure. On Friday, October 22, Oscar underwent surgery to remove the mass which included removal of his right kidney, spleen, and a part of his pancreas. Thankfully, the surgery was a success. His heart did well and the pacemaker was removed the following day. Currently, he continues to be treated for the blood clot, so now all that is left is to wait on pathology results to see what further treatment will be necessary. This was very sudden and unexpected for the family. Anyone that knows Oscar knows his dedication to his work and his heart for helping others. The family asks for your continued prayers so he can be home with his boys and as he adjusts to this new normal. ",13280,15000,4 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/get-owen-a-service-dog,Get Owen A Service Dog," Hello, all! My name is Ashley, and I am the mother of Owen. He is the sweetest, most resilient and determined two year old I’ve ever known. Owen was born, after a completely normal pregnancy, and went on the spend 109 days in the NICU. In that time, Owen was diagnosed with charge syndrome, and also received a tracheostomy and a g-tube. Charge syndrome comes with a lot of medical anomalies and conditions. One of the charge related anomalies is the absence semicircular canals. Semicircular canals help the body balance itself. Therefore, he’s very unstable. We were told in the NICU he may not walk until he is 5. Owen surprised everyone, in every profession, by walking without a walker(for short distances) by the age of two! He still falls, A LOT. But that doesn’t stop him. Our goal with this go fund me account is to raise money to get Owen a service dog that will serve as a brace dog for him. A best friend that he can hold on to without needing medical equipment to stabilize him. As well as a little bit of freedom for this wild two year old. The dog will also be trained to alert us if he coughs/chokes or if his alarms are going off in the middle of the night and we aren’t reacting fast enough. We have night nursing for him, but not always. My biggest fear as a mother, is that I will sleep through an alarm or a cough and something happen to Owen. My husband and I have 3 kids, all under 3 years old. My husband works a lot and I’m a SAHM and honestly, I’m always exhausted. Therefore, the fear of sleeping through an emergency alarm is a a very real possibility, considering I know I have slept through non emergency alarms before. The local service dog agency quoted us $40,000-60,000 for a dog with a minimum 2 year wait, and insurance won’t cover any of it. So, with that too far out of reach, we decided to take a different route and have a dog trained by a qualified professional instead. *We are so BLESSED to say that a breeder has offered to donate a puppy to us, which saves us thousands of dollars! ❤️ While, the cost of doing it this way, on top of a *donated* dog, is WAY less than going through an agency. It’s still definitely not chump change. The price for shipping, training, boarding and other costs associated with the “making” a service dog, is still going to be in the thousands. We thought about waiting to do this, but the training process is long and extensive, and it makes more sense to start now rather than later. So, by the Tim his dog is ready, he’ll have a brace dog for school. If you’ve made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read! If you aren’t able to donate at this time, please consider sharing this page! Thank you! ",3755,7000,4 days

I'm putting this GoFundMe together along with my siblings in an effort to reduce the many stresses that come along with the extended hospitalization of our stepfather, Jason Adams. Jason drove himself to Urgent Care on September 22nd, 2021. That was the day that our family was changed forever. He was transferred to MUSC Kershaw's emergency room. A CT scan showed pancreatitis, and they knew that he would need to be treated at a different hospital. He was transferred to Providence Hospital where he spent twelve days between a regular room, critical care, and the ICU. He had an event that required a neurosurgeon, and he was transferred to Prisma Richland. This is where he continues to fight in surgical trauma ICU after multiple organ failures. My mother spends every single visiting hour at Jason's side. We remain faithful that he will win this fight. Jason and my mother are the parents of my eight-year-old sister, Laycee. Laycee has been the strongest little girl in the world. Laycee is strong. Mom is strong. Jason continues to be stronger than anyone could have imagined. Your food and financial donations through MealTrain have been delicious and have helped reduce some financial anxiety. Unfortunately, Jason's hospitalization is going to last longer than we had ever imagined possible. Jason has 12 weeks of short-term disability, and my mother returning to work is not an option at this time. My mother will then be the sole financial provider and caretaker for the family, and the loss of income is life-changing. I never know what to say or how to help, but I know that any donations made here will make life that much easier for them as they plan for the future. As I write this, Jason is fighting his 34th day in hospital. Thank you for everything you've already done. I'll try and post as much as I can. Please share this and remember that we love and appreciate you! ",1810,10000,4 days

To All who know and love Joy, In March of 2021, after seeking medical help for pain in her arm and chest, Joy was diagnosed with Stage 3 inflammatory Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. Specialists fast tracked her care due to the aggressive and advanced nature of this type of breast cancer. She has already completed 22 rounds of Chemotherapy which has wreaked havoc on her physically and financially, making it difficult for her to live the independent and active lifestyle that she is accustomed to. Between weekly blood-work, chemo, and oncology appointments, fighting cancer has become her full time job. Joy has bravely accepted the next phase of her treatment, and in 2 weeks she will undergo a Bilateral Mastectomy. After this very intrusive surgery, she will need 4-6 weeks of rest and care at home before beginning two months of radiation therapy. As you know, Joy is a BOSS in the kitchen and garden, and an accomplished teacher in the Bikram yoga community. She is determined to beat this cancer and come back better and stronger than ever. As independent and proud as Joy is, it has not been easy for her to ask for help, so I am reaching out on her behalf. This goal of $100,000 is intended to cover past and future medical treatments, alternative and complementary care, rent & living expenses, and loss of earnings. The hope is to at least alleviate the financial stress of this intensely difficult chapter in Joy’s life so that she can focus on healing and the future.Whether you are a friend from Maui, Martha’s Vineyard, Georgia, Bikram or have adventured together during her travels, Joy holds you all deep in her heart. She is humbled and grateful for the messages she has received from around the World. Please continue to reach out to her, your encouragement brings great strength. And please share this link with any and all who may feel compelled to help with Joy’s healing journey.Thank you for your love and support!      ",21436,100000,7-Sep-21

In March of this year, 2021, he was diagnosed with Stage 3 colon cancer. To say this was a devastating blow to our family is an understatement because this news rocked our worlds. However, Ryan went into this ready for battle. And what a battle it has and still is. In the course of being unable to work, he eventually was let go at the job he had for many many years at Logan city and with it went the little health insurance he had. Emergency funds were quickly drained all the while they have fervently been applying for aide from the government. Thus far NOTHING in the way of this aide has come through. So it was with much reluctance from his family that I was requested to set this page up. They have always been industrious independent people and asking for help does not come in their nature but in times of crisis one must do what one has to. So it my heartfelt hope that we can raise the funds to help them during this difficult time and pray that at the end of this we will have my healthy, strong, amazing brother back to where he should be.

Ella comenzó hace 2 años a padecer de asma razón por la cual empezaron a medicarla, pero al pasar del tiempo su asma empezó con más constancia todos los meses estaba en Emergencias a recibir primeros auxilios, pero su asma siguió más agresiva hasta que un día su crisis fue muy fuerte y quedó inconsciente por falta de respiración fue en marzo 2020 que descubrieron que una enorme masa estaba comprimiendo su tráquea y esto le causaba la asfixia y no llegaba aire a sus pulmones ni a su cerebro, comenzaron a estabilizarla con cargas fuertes de esteroides lo que le causó aumento de peso y empezó a depender de oxígeno todo el tiempo, así pasó todo esos meses hasta que en Junio 2020 deciden operarla, en medio de la operación empezó a sangrar no pudieron continuar razón la cual decidieron cerrarla sin extraer nada. Por causa de la gravedad del sangrado estuvo en cuidados intensivos por 7 días, deciden ponerla en observación fuera de cuidados intensivos pero esta vez no sentía sus piernas. Duro una recuperación de ese hecho 2 meses y logró estabilizarse. Después de ese tiempo se le hace una biopsia la cual su diagnóstico dice que tiene un Linfoma de Hodgkin Clásico + Tumor de Mediastino. Para poder resolver el tamaño del tumor necesita varias sesiones de quimioterapia para poder reducirlo y luego operar. Cualquier tipo de ayuda es enormemente agradecida. Muchas gracias. She is Gladys Mercedes Alfonseca Rodoli, she is 23 years old, she lives in the Dominican Republic, she is a law student, she is a very enthusiastic young woman, she likes to share with her family, read, listen to music, but the most important thing for her is your Faith in GOD.She began to suffer from asthma 2 years ago, which is why they began to medicate her, but as time went by, her asthma began with more constancy every month she was in the Emergency Room to receive first aid, but her asthma continued to be more aggressive until one day her crisis was very strong and she was unconscious due to lack of breathing it was in March 2020 that they discovered that a huge mass was compressing her windpipe and this was causing her suffocation and no air was reaching her lungs or brain, they began to stabilize her with heavy loads of steroids which caused her to gain weight and she began to depend on oxygen all the time, so all those months passed until in June 2020 they decided to operate her, in the middle of the operation she began to bleed they could not continue, which is why they decided to close her without extracting anything . Due to the severity of the bleeding she was in intensive care for 7 days, they decided to put her under observation outside of intensive care but this time she did not feel her legs. A recovery from that fact lasted 2 months and managed to stabilize.  After that time a biopsy is done which his diagnosis says that he has a Classic Hodgkin Lymphoma + Mediastinal Tumor. In order to resolve the size of the tumor, you need several chemotherapy sessions to be able to reduce it and then operate. Any kind of help is greatly appreciated. Thank you. ",1195,14000,19-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-becca-recover,Help Becca Recover," As many of our friends and family know my wife was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa in 2015. Since then, she has been in the process of recovery. Like many people, the pandemic has presented challenges for her mental health. Add to this a series of events that have made an already tough job into a struggle that has caused a relapse. First, there was the pandemic. Then, she lost a friend to cancer. Not long after, Becca lost her job of eight years as a nanny of two girls who are like family. As a result, she was faced with trying to build her piano studio in the middle of a pandemic. Finally, this summer, we received notice of a 40% rent increase. In 2015, we were fortunate enough to catch it before things got too serious to be handled with the resources we had on hand. This time around, things are well beyond what they were then. Becca's doctor recommended she seek a residential program. Her therapist supported this recommendation. They both felt that her anorexia was so far beyond Becca's control that she would need this level of care to successfully recover. After some research, Becca found an excellent program. We spoke with an intake specialist and, due to the severity of Becca's symptoms, the intake specialist recommended Becca receive residential treatment. This means that she would be staying at a facility and working on her recovery with people who specialize in treating eating disorders. In approximately 4-6 weeks, Becca will be headed to the Emily Program in Cleveland, Ohio, where she will most likely be for 4-6 weeks. Following this portion of treatment, she will return home and have several weeks of intensive day long programming from home. The total for the residential portion of treatment is $36,000 per month. Unfortunately, it is all too common for insurance to not cover residential treatment. Becca's case is one of the many that won't be covered by insurance. Normally, we are hesitant to ask others for money, but this is one cost in the many that will come over the next year or two for her recovery through this program. Becca will not be working for ten to twelve weeks, which will cause an additional financial strain. We are hoping with the help of friends, family, and maybe even strangers, that we will be able to avoid a lifetime of medical debt. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. 20% of people suffering from anorexia will prematurely die from complications related to their eating disorder, including suicide and heart problems. A study by the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders reported that 5–10% of anorexics die within 10 years after contracting the disease; 18-20% of anorexics will be dead after 20 years and only 30–40% ever fully recover. Becca is determined to be one of those 30-40% to recover. Thank you in advance for any help that you are able to provide! ",2707,20000,3 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/karin-larry-need-your-help,Karin & Larry need your help," As many of you know, my big sister has been struggling with breast cancer and chemotherapy for about a year. She has really tried to have a positive outlook on the situation but she just can not get a break.  Our family has watched our beautiful sister, daughter, wife, mother, and grandmother quickly lose weight and deteriorate.  It has been such a fast process that there was no way for her and Larry to plan for it emotionally or financially.  Larry has been spending all of his time trying to provide the emotional support that Karin desperately needs. Therefore, he has used up every hour of PTO that he had available.  Karin has been too weak to be on her feet all day at work so she has not been earning any money. They finally got through her last chemotherapy session and they were trying to be optimistic but her treatment had terribly weakened her body. Her lack of strength resulted in her fainting and suffering a fall where she ended up with a concussion and a broken nose.  Even at this point, she was trying to make jokes about how she looked like the grandpa from the Addams Family and how appropriate it was to look as she did during the Halloween season.   As their hospital bills roll in and she continues to have multiple doctor appointments scheduled, she is not only having difficulty being positive about her situation but she is also getting scared.  In the front of her mind, she realizes that she also has  breast surgery coming up which will be an additional cost. If you are unable to donate, that is ok.  Please at the least leave some encouraging words for her and Larry. They need to believe that they will get through this troubling time, beat this cancer, and have faith that this is all temporary. Having a positive outlook does help with healing. Please help me and our family encourage and support her. https://share.icloud.com/photos/0zkE3IEYof2QgTgebY8RaVa3Q Thank you, Little sister #1 Laura Little sister #2 Amy Biggest sister Nancy ",2775,5000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-save-bjs-sandwich-shop-in-big-bear-city,Help Save BJ's Sandwich Shop in Big Bear City," BJ’s Sandwich Shop is a Big Bear institution. While the motto is “Cold beer and lousy food”, only half of that is true. With burgers as big as your head, sandwiches with meat cut fresh daily, and homemade side salads, BJ’s has kept locals and tourists alike fed for over 40 years. Whether you’re riding with Hells Angels or riding a 10 speed, BJ’s has a place for you.  Restaurants across the country have been through a very trying couple of years. With government shutdowns, increased food costs, and changing county requirements every other week, BJ’s pulled through. Through all of this, Chuck and Heidi made sure to offer locals a place to forget all the troubles of Covid-19, all at a fair price.  Covid has taken its toll on Big Bear in so many ways, and now it has placed BJ’s Sandwich Shop in the crosshairs. Chuck has happily (well maybe a little grouchily) made a second home for so many across the Big Bear Valley, working every single day the restaurant’s doors are open until close. BJ’s closed their doors a couple of weeks back when Chuck came down with Covid and has yet to reopen. While Chuck is battling, we wanted to give back so that finances are not another worry on his mind. Chuck and Heidi are far too proud to ever ask for a donation, but as a community that takes care of its own, I felt that people in the valley may want to donate whatever is in their power to make sure BJ’s isn’t another one of COVID’s victims.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if you have any money to spare, please consider a donation ",13475,25000,19-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-jose-in-his-battle-against-als,Support José's battle against ALS,"Jennifer Barrett Fajardo is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Jose Fajardo. Aloha, friends and family Since the announcement of my ALS diagnosis, many of you have asked how you could help. Jen and I have been overwhelmed with your love, aloha, and support. Thank you for being a part of Team José. Earlier this month, we traveled to Texas Neurology, located in Dallas, for a series of preliminary tests that put me in the queue to be enrolled in the Healey ALS Platform Trial. Participating in a clinical trial is my way of helping science find a cure for ALS, and it may also lead to opportunities for me to access promising new drug treatments.  Everyone at Texas Neurology was great and we're immensely grateful to the many people who helped to make this connection possible. Yesterday, we received the happy news that I've cleared the initial screening for the trial (hooray!) and we are eager to complete my enrollment and get started. We anticipate regular trips between Dallas and Honolulu over the next six to seven months. While the travel will be stressful, it is an important part of my journey and fight. We are lucky to have begun building a great healthcare team, but Hawaii’s location and small number of ALS cases mean that participation in medical trials (and even access to some medical treatments) requires visits to the mainland. ALS comes out of nowhere and immediately makes a significant impact on one’s health, lifestyle, and financial resources. We've established this fundraising campaign to help with two immediate needs:  expenses related to my participation in the clinical trial (mostly our frequent travel to/from Dallas) home modifications that will make our living space safer, and extend my independence as my movement has become more limited Many of you have asked how you can help. Contributing to this campaign is ONE way to help.  If you are able to contribute financially in any amount, we humbly welcome the monetary support. That said, please know that there are other equally important ways to lend your support--through advocacy, words of encouragement, and more. We've shared a few ideas on the Team José website  and encourage you to visit the site and subscribe for updates. Thanks for being part of Team José and my circle of support. I’m grateful that you are joining Jen and me in our fight AND for helping build the larger wave needed to ensure that we take ALS from terminal to treatable. Treatments are within reach that will halt progression and make this a livable disease for me and others currently afflicted by this cruel disease. ",29400,25000,22-Sep-21

His name is Elijah Hertzler. Elijah has a heart condition that has made him have lots of surgeries.  Elijah loves football and he’s good at it, too. He loves playing with friends,  Avengers movies (especially Black Panther), and he’s so funny. Ten weeks ago he went to the hospital because he felt sick.  He had an infection in his heart.  Then, it spread to his kidneys and feet and he almost died.  Elijah knows Jesus, but we were really worried.  Elijah is getting better now.  But he had to have both of his feet amputated.  Life is going to be really different for Elijah now. He will learn to walk again but he will need prosthetics and therapy.   Elijah came home on Friday. We had a big parade around town with all our friends, the police and a fire truck. I finally got to see Elijah.   My mom and I are raising money to help Elijah’s family.   They need to make some changes to the bathroom in the house so Elijah can go alone.  (He’s 11. Who wants their mom in the bathroom? Not me.) They need help with a special kind of wheelchair. They need gas money for the trips to Grand Rapids for therapy. (The hospital he has to go to is an hour and a half away).  Would you pray for Elijah and the Hertzlers? And can you help us raise money to help them? Thank you, Ryan Nienhuis  (Age 11) ",15262,15000,19-Oct-21

Hi, we are Brittany and Elmer, Elijah's mom and dad. Eli has had a really hard start to life in the last almost 2 years. Among other smaller diagnosies, Eli has had lots of issues with his head. From a concussion, to abnormal head growth, brain swelling and other things, Eli has recently been regressing. In May, Eli was running around, playing with baby brother, the happiest kid in the world, until his head started growing rapidly. He has since been admitted for testing, and has spent countless amounts of hours in appointments and therapies. In June, Eli had to learn how to walk again and he has never picked back up all the words he lost. September 9th, Eli was in the emergency room. They now believe that every tumble he takes, is causing brain injury. Every 2 year old falls (quite often), but to Eli, it could be devastating. The emergency room doctors are thinking a possible degenerative brain disease, which is a very scary, and life-threatening diagnosis. However, we cannot be sure until we see a new neurologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. This hospital is over 4 hours away from home, without any stops for snacks or diaper changes. Which is super important to young children like Eli! Mom and Dad would like to stay down in Philadelphia the night before as Eli's appointment is the next morning at 8 am for testing. This appointment cannot be missed as it may lead us to some answers that we have desperately been searching for! The issue is, Mom and Dad can simply not afford it at this time. While we are working hard at coming up with the money, we are just not sure that's plausible between now and October 27th. Any help would be greatly appreciated to help us get Eli to this important doctors appointment that may help save his life. Thank you all so much for reading our story; and thank you for sharing and helping in anyway possible. ❤  ",4966,10000,12-Sep-21

I’m fundraising for a homeless man who came to the clinic for a check up. He is 65 years old and is currently living in his car. He lost his house after his wife passed away last year. He was sobbing in the exam room and even apologized that he may smell next time he comes into the office because he can’t afford a Motel 6 often. I can’t even begin to understand the shame he feels. He has NO ONE besides his dog who lives with him in his car, that’s all he has to live for, according to him. He has uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure from eating whatever processed food he can afford and after we identified blood in his stool, he needs a colonoscopy. This man needs our help and I’m asking you all to help him at least get temporary housing, even if it’s a hotel for a few extra nights. Some clean clothes, a few days of warm meals. A man who has worked his whole life doesn’t deserve a life of indignity. His life matters. In the richest country in the history of the world, this should never happen. Ever. It speaks volumes on the lack of social safety nets in this country that have been gutted slowly in the last 40 years. This fundraiser is just a bandaid on a larger more complex issue.

Nota: Para mi familia, la traducción al Español se encuentra al final. My name is Nora and as some of you may know, I am a young breast cancer survivor. Initially diagnosed at the age of 32 with a stage 2 aggressive tumor, I fought a difficult battle and went through six rounds of aggressive chemotherapy, followed by two surgeries, physical therapy, and further treatment. During that trying season, it was my faith along with the outpouring of support from friends, family, and even strangers that allowed me to persevere. I truly believe that God’s love and presence was reflected in ways big and small through the support of others. Fast forward to this spring, my husband Everett and I finally decided to try and have children after being cancer free for 5 years. We were later overjoyed at the news that we would be expecting our first child in February 2022. I’m currently five months pregnant and thankfully, Baby G has been healthy and strong. We cannot wait to meet Baby G and already love him so much! But the unexpected happened six years after my initial diagnosis, it was discovered that the breast cancer had returned. Thankfully, my husband and I caught it in time before it spread. While it is stage 1, it is again, an aggressive tumor. This has tossed us into a whirlwind of medical appointments, endless research, and major decisions regarding the most appropriate treatment plan for myself (and Baby G). As you can imagine, this journey has been filled with some very difficult moments for Everett and I, as the sobering reality of a second cancer diagnosis hit during a season that was meant to be full of excitement and anticipation. In light of the various consults, tests, and research we have undertaken, surgery to remove the tumor will be an immediate first step. Chemotherapy during pregnancy is being discussed by my clinical team, along with radiation treatment after the baby is born to help prevent recurrence. However, there are serious risks involved and as such, we are trying to integrate proven, non-toxic treatments that will not pose any serious risks or long-term health issues for Baby G and I and, God willing, will lead to long-term, CANCER-FREE health for myself. Many of these treatments may require me to travel out-of-state and take time off of work without enough coverage for a full medical leave for treatment and maternity leave.  Unfortunately, these services are also extremely expensive and not covered by health insurance. Without sufficient financial support, it will bring substantial financial strain and debt on my husband and I at a time when we long to focus on the joy of planning and preparing for our first child. Between the costs of these services (estimated at $65,000 - $78,000), potential unpaid time off for my both my husband and I, a new baby, and travel, we are needing to come up with $100,000. We are determined that I will be fully healed and are taking into our hands what is in our control, leaving the rest up to our Savior, the ultimate Healer and Provider. We believe in the power of prayer, and know that God hears every single one. We ask that you keep us in your constant prayers for: Complete physical healing over myself and a long life spent with my family. Protection over Baby G’s health during surgery and throughout the pregnancy. Encouragement, strength, and health over Everett, who has made various sacrifices and gone above and beyond to support me during this very challenging time. A covering over our marriage as we make difficult decisions together; that we would be united and place God at the center. Wisdom over the doctors who will be helping me on my healing journey. An outpouring of financial favor during this difficult time and protection from further debt. A further deepening of our faith, and discernment to follow God’s direction for our future. Thank you in advance for considering our request for prayer and financial support. If you would like to walk with us on the journey, we will be providing updates about treatments, the baby and my personal health at our CaringBridge site. ************ ESPAÑOL: Mi nombre es Nora y, como algunos de ustedes saben, soy una joven sobreviviente de cáncer de mama. Inicialmente diagnosticada a la edad de 32 años con un tumor agresivo en etapa 2, luché una batalla difícil y pasé por seis rondas de quimioterapia agresiva, seguidas de dos cirugías, fisioterapia y tratamiento adicional. Durante esa temporada difícil, fue mi fe junto con el gran apoyo de amigos, familiares e incluso extraños lo que me permitió perseverar. Realmente creo que el amor y la presencia de Dios se reflejaron de maneras grandes y pequeñas a través del apoyo de otros. Esta primavera, mi esposo Everett y yo finalmente decidimos intentar tener hijos después de estar libre de cáncer durante 5 años. Más tarde nos alegramos mucho con la noticia de que estaríamos esperando nuestro primer hijo en Febrero de 2022. Actualmente estoy embarazada de cinco meses y, afortunadamente, Baby G ha estado saludable y fuerte. ¡Estamos ansiosos por conocer a Baby G y ya lo amamos tanto! Pero sucedió lo inesperado cuando seis años después de mi diagnóstico inicial, se descubrió que el cáncer había regresado. Afortunadamente, mi esposo y yo lo detectamos a tiempo antes de que se extendiera. Aunque se encuentra en la etapa 1, nuevamente es un tumor agresivo. Esto nos ha arrojado a un torbellino de citas médicas, investigaciones interminables y decisiones importantes con respecto al plan de tratamiento más apropiado para mí (y para Baby G). Como pueden imaginar, este viaje a estado llenas de momentos muy difíciles para Everett y para mí, ya que la triste realidad de un segundo diagnóstico de cáncer golpeó durante una temporada que debía estar llena de emoción y anticipación. A la luz de las diversas consultas, pruebas e investigaciones que hemos realizado, la cirugía para extirpar el tumor será un primer paso inmediato. Mi equipo clínico está discutiendo la quimioterapia durante el embarazo, junto con el tratamiento de radiación después del nacimiento del bebé para ayudar a prevenir la recurrencia. Sin embargo, existen graves riesgos con los que no estamos en paz; Estamos tratando de integrar tratamientos probados y no tóxicos que no supongan ningún riesgo grave o problemas de salud a largo plazo para Baby G y para mí y, si Dios quiere, me llevarán a una salud a largo plazo LIBRE DE CÁNCER. Muchos de estos tratamientos pueden requerir que viaje fuera del estado y me ausente del trabajo sin suficiente cobertura para una ausencia médica completa para tratamiento y ausencia por maternidad. Desafortunadamente, estos servicios también son extremadamente costosos y no los cubre el seguro médico. Sin el apoyo financiero suficiente, mi esposo y yo tendremos una tensión financiera y deudas sustanciales en un momento en el que anhelamos concentrarnos en la alegría de planificar y prepararnos para nuestro primer hijo. Entre los costos de estos servicios (estimados en $ 65,000 - $ 78,000), tiempo libre potencial no remunerado, un nuevo bebé y viajes, necesitamos aportar $100,000. Estamos decididos a curarme por completo y estamos tomando en nuestras manos lo que está bajo nuestro control, dejando el resto a nuestro Salvador, el Sanador y Proveedor supremo. Creemos en el poder de la oración y sabemos que Dios escucha a cada uno. Les pedimos que nos mantengan en sus constantes oraciones por: Sanación física completa sobre mí y una larga vida con mi familia. Protección de la salud de Baby G durante la cirugía y durante el embarazo. Aliento, fuerza y ​​salud sobre Everett, quien ha hecho varios sacrificios y ha hecho todo lo posible para apoyarme durante este momento tan desafiante. Un encubrimiento de nuestro matrimonio mientras tomamos juntos decisiones difíciles; que estaríamos unidos y colocaríamos a Dios en el centro. Sabiduría sobre los médicos que me ayudarán en mi viaje de sanación. Una efusión de favores financieros durante este momento difícil y protección contra más deudas. Una mayor profundización de nuestra fe y discernimiento para seguir la dirección de Dios para nuestro futuro. Gracias de antemano por considerar nuestra solicitud de oración y apoyo financiero. Estaremos brindando actualizaciones sobre los tratamientos, el bebé y mi salud personal en nuestro sitio CaringBridge si desean acompañarnos en el viaje. ",46841,100000,12-Sep-21

Bob had a stroke that has left him with some complicated medical issues. Anyone who knows him knows he is up for the fight, but he needs the support of his friends and family now more than ever. On Sunday, October 10th, Bob passed out while he was visiting with friends. He was transported by ambulance to the emergency room where tests showed that he had a stroke that affected the optical portion of his brain. He is struggling with short term memory loss and is currently unable to read. Further testing revealed a lesion on his brain and another in his lung. These unfortunate discoveries are still being analyzed, and we will update everyone as soon as we have answers and a treatment plan. While Bob is recovering and relearning how to perform everyday tasks, he will no longer be able to continue his job as a driver's ed instructor. With all of the uncertainty surrounding Bob’s health, the last thing he and Jane should have to worry about is finances. He is an amazing man who has given so much to others, and now it is our turn to give to him. Please keep him in your prayers as they navigate through all that is happening. Maybe Bob has been your coworker, your state Grange master, your confidant, your scoutmaster, your church member, your quartet partner, or a member of your chorus or most importantly your friend. We have always been able to count on him, let’s show him that he can count on us! -Bob’s Family ",8850,10000,19-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/deacons-defenders,Deacon's Defenders - Next Steps,"Emily Schafer Brown is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Aaron Orlowski. Hi, my name is Emily Brown and I'm organizing this Go Fund Me for my amazing (warrior) nephew, Deacon (15) and his incredible family, the Orlowski's. For those of you who have been following and faithfully praying for Deacon throughout his almost 3-year long battle with cancer, THANK YOU! Words can't express the Orlowski's (and all of Deacon's extended family's) depth of gratitude for your continuous prayers. I'm going to give a quick recap of the events that have unfolded over the last month or so; for those of you who don't know Deacon's story, I've shared a brief history further down in this post. Thank you, thank you, thank you for taking the time to read this, pray, and if God lays it on your heart, donate financially to this wonderful family. On Tuesday, September 7th, Deacon was scheduled to begin a new chemo regimen - a new plan that wouldn't be so hard on his body, to give him a chance to keep working to fight the cancer but not cause him to need so much downtime between treatments for his body to recover. On that day, however, Deacon's team of doctors requested scans to be done based on the swelling in Deacon's face. He had an MRI done on Thursday the 9th and a PET scan on Monday the 13th; by the next day their family received very difficult news - the MRI and PET scans confirmed that the tumors had expanded, and there were a few new small spots on his ribs and vertebrae. Deacon's amazing team of doctors quickly began exploring the possibility of immunotherapy, after determining that long-term chemotherapy options had been exhausted. After two very anxious and heavy weeks, Dr. Kitchen confirmed that Seattle Children's Hospital has two immunotherapy clinical trials that align with Deacon's diagnosis and the possibility of him being a candidate for therapy. There is a lot of data that the medical team is still in the process of reviewing on Deacon's medical history and candidacy, but it is looking favorable that he will be accepted as a participant in one of the two trials for treatment. The challenge right now is time, as both clinical trials do not begin until November. With the aggressiveness of his cancer, Deacon underwent 1 more round of chemotherapy, and will undergo 1 more round of radiation beginning this Monday, as bridge treatments until he and his family can get to Seattle. Bridge treatment is considered a treatment that will help 'bridge the gap' of time to get to the next step; in this case, it is immunotherapy treatment for Deacon. To clarify, Deacon's submission is still in the process of being reviewed, so there are still many unknowns at this time, but as Kori has shared, ""we have a plan, and we still have hope."" Many people have reached out to Kori and Aaron asking how they can help; fervent prayer for their family and Deacon's medical team is the number one priority, but there are also going to be many continued expenses, especially in this new phase of the journey with Seattle and all the accompanying travel, housing costs, etc. Please consider blessing this wonderful family with a monetary gift of any amount to help offset these expenses; it is a privilege for us all to help carry them during this incredibly challenging time. They have been, and continue to be, faith-filled warriors - thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for continuing to join us in defending our superhero, Deacon. The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth. He fulfills the desires of those who fear him; he hears their cry and saves them. Psalm 145:18-19 Deacon's Story: In December of 2018, Deacon Orlowski had surgery to remove what doctors thought was a benign tumor in his jaw. After the tumor removal and 11 biopsies, the tumor was STILL thought to be benign. It wasn't until January of 2019 and a special lab process that Deacon was diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare form of pediatric cancer. Following the diagnosis, Deacon endured 57 weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. After those 57 weeks, in June of 2020, Deacon went for his final appointment and rang the bell as he left. He came home and celebrated with family and close friends, but 2 days later his parents got a call that Deacon's final scans showed that his cancer had returned. Deacon immediately started ""bridge therapy"" with a high potency chemo. During this time, they did a biopsy on Deacon's tumor to gene map it - the plan was to start targeted gene therapy as soon as the results of the genetic mapping came back. The chemo ended, and transitioned immediately into the targeted gene therapy. A couple days into this new treatment, Deacon noticed that his tumor (which was quite large and visible) had softened and gotten smaller. It continued this trend over the next couple of weeks, and it seemed that the bridge therapy did it's job and killed the cancer. The months of August and September of 2020 were spent doing gene therapy which entailed 5 pills a day. Deacon was feeling great, as the pills for this course of treatment caused little to no side effects (unlike the chemo). In early October of 2020, however, Deacon started to have pain in his jaw and noticed his cheek was beginning to swell again. On October 6th, it was confirmed that the tumor had returned. So once again, after almost 2 years into the journey, the Orlowski’s were forced to change course. Deacon began chemo and radiation immediately; radiation entailed trips down to Beaumont, 5 days a week for 6 weeks (on rotation), and chemo required 5 day infusions every 4 weeks at Mott Children's Hospital. After several months of intense treatment, the Orlowski’s received encouraging news from Deacon’s scans at the end of January, 2021 - the tumors had shrunk significantly. Deacon began a new targeted therapy drug and outpatient chemo treatments, but at his next scans in April, it was discovered that the tumors were growing again. Since April, the Orlowski’s and their team of doctors have had to make many tough treatment decisions and frequently shift course based on how Deacon’s body reacted to the now necessary, higher doses of chemo. They’ve had to navigate treatments, hospitalizations for infections after treatment, low counts with multiple blood and platelet transfusions, finding a happy medium on a treatment schedule and dosage, and the physical, mental, and emotional toll that this journey has taken. Scans in early July revealed that the more intense chemo treatments were making an impact; the tumors had shrunk by approximately 25%. On July 19th, Deacon went in for his next round of chemo, this time with reduced dosages, with the hope that the chemo would keep doing its job against the cancer cells while giving his body a chance to recover, and hopefully out of the hospital so often. The last couple of treatments had been very hard on Deacon; his body began taking longer and longer to bounce back and recover to levels suitable to start chemo again, even with drugs that helped boost his bone marrow production. Due to low counts every time they were checked, prior to his next scheduled chemo treatment, his next treatment had to keep getting pushed back; the 5-day inpatient chemo treatment the week of July 19th ended up being his last full chemo treatment until the bridge therapy he just completed at the end of September.

The morning of September 22, 2021 John Begor suffered sudden cardiac arrest while working at Lowe’s. This was completely unexpected given he has no major medical history other than asthma and allergies. Thankfully since John was at work, CPR was performed for 10 minutes and he was shocked with an AED by EMTs in order to get a pulse back. John was brought to the local hospital UVM Health Network at CVPH. He was admitted to the ICU where he was on the mechanical ventilator and sedated for 15 days while in a semi-comatose state.  John was diagnosed with an anoxic brain injury (lack of oxygen to the brain) as a result of the cardiac arrest, which was caused by ventricular fibrillation. After running multiple tests doctors found no signs of blockages or clots, however his heart was found to be pumping at 10%. With the normal range for someone his age being above 50%, doctors have informed us that John’s heart is very weak and he is at a high risk for another cardiac arrest.  On Thursday, October 7th he underwent two procedures to place a trach and feeding tube which are long term, life-assisting devices to help John with his recovery. On Friday, October 8th John is off all sedation and mechanical ventilation. He is breathing on his own and starting to look more alert. Currently, we don’t know the extent of his neurological deficits and what his future will look like. John has lived as an avid golfer, outdoorsman, craftsman, and devout family man. With all the uncertainties we don’t know if John will ever be able to do the things he loves again. Thankfully he is slowly making progress in the right direction. Family, friends and healthcare professionals are hopeful for a slow and steady recovery. We have heard from several doctors that this will be a long road with no clear end goal known.  John has always looked out for others and he would never ask for help, but we are asking on his behalf for prayers, donations, and the sharing of this fund. The goal of this GoFundMe is to provide some financial relief to the family to assist with the cost of his medical bills and possibly help with his future rehabilitation. All donations will go directly to a family-owned bank account specifically set-up to assist with this cause.  ",14203,5000,8-Oct-21

Update October 2021: Matthew's leukemia has returned with a vengeance. He is down in Boston undergoing chemotherapy until they decide on a more long term course of action. Carmen is staying in a nearby hotel and is with him as much as possible. Ford is dividing his time between operating the Mansfield Dairy and driving down to Boston each weekend to be with Matthew and Carmen. They have been there for us providing milk and other necessities throughout the pandemic. Now they need our support at this difficult time. Any donation to help defray the medical costs, travel costs and food and lodging costs would be greatly appreciated. History: The Small Family of Mansfield Dairy in Stowe are facing difficult times. Matthew Small, 21, who attended schools in Stowe and Morrisville was working alongside his father at the dairy until last week when he was diagnosed with leukemia. Everything happened fast as he was moved from Copley to Burlington to Dana Farber. Carmen, his mother is staying in Boston with him and his father Ford is traveling back and forth to Boston in between delivering milk. Matthew will be at Dana Farber for the next month if not longer receiving chemotherapy treatments. The doctors seem very optimistic about the outcome of the treatment which will include a bone marrow transplant fairly quickly. Money raised through this Go Fund Me site will be used for lodging and meals in the Boston area, gas for transport back and forth, and deductibles that arise from the gap in insurance. It is just a start, as we have no idea where this journey of theirs will take them, but hopefully, all of us, as friends, neighbors, and avid milk drinkers we can come together to help them during tough times. Please consider donating so this kind family can focus on Matthew and not on the mounting bills. ",32254,30000,21-Jan-19

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-dr-roger-as-he-fights-for-his-life,Help Dr. Roger as He Fights for His Life," My dad, Dr. Roger Salindong, tested positive for COVID using a home antigen test kit on Sept 28. He started to have fever and other symptoms, showing signs of covid progression. By October 5th, his O2 saturation was dropping so we needed to find an oxygen tank for him at home. At this point, he needed 24-hour oxygen support - we had to find oxygen tank refills even at the wee hours of night. However, his O2 saturation was still unstable so we had to get him to the ER of Paranaque Doctors Hospital on October 10th so that he could be closely monitored. He was confirmed COVID positive using RTPCR test. He started HNFC (high nasal flow cannula) oxygen therapy, and IV antiviral/antibiotic treatment. My mom was also admitted and received treatment since she was also COVID positive. She already completed treatment and was discharged from the hospital last Tuesday, October 19th. Praise God! For my dad though, it was different. He had to be intubated on October 13 and admitted to the ICU. He is on mechanical ventilation and requires 70-100% oxygen (currently at 100%). He started his 1st session of hemoperfusion then. On October 15th, my dad began presenting signs of multi-organ failure. According to his cardiologist, he already has myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscles) and possible pulmonary embolism (blood clot to the lungs). His nephrologist also mentioned that he already has acute kidney injury but we were advised to continue his hemoperfusion treatment. Because of sepsis, his doctors told us that he is presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The next day, October 16th, my dad is still intubated and sedated but his blood gases showed little improvement as compared to previous days. His O2 levels remained stable, and so were the rest of his vital signs. When asked about his chances of recovery, however, the doctors were in agreement that he has a poor prognosis, due to complications and his dependence on mechanical ventilation. ""It's difficult to bring him back to the way he was,"" said one of his doctors. My dad completed his last session of hemoperfusion on October 21st. Even after multiple attempts at different treatments, my dad still does not show any signs of improvement. Per his attending physician, he has been unconscious since October 22nd. He is still hanging on but the doctors told us to be prepared because there is possibility of a cardiac arrest at this point. They have been administering inotropic support because his blood pressure has been dropping. They have been constantly monitoring him in the ICU since. We do not lose hope and trust that God is in control even during this difficult time. We are knocking on your kind hearts to help us support our dad at this time. As a physician himself, my dad has been practicing medicine for well over 35 years now. He has seen and taken care of hundreds of patients throughout his medical career. So if you are reading this, we humbly implore you to help us take care of our beloved doctor and father. We are faced with mounting hospital bills which have been depleting our finances, so any help you can extend to our family is highly appreciated. Thank you and may God bless you in return.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-chuck-while-hes-healing,Help Chuck Shay while he’s healing," Hi everyone! My name is Jenn Strohm and brother Chuck is currently in the hospital trying to recover from complications caused from Covid. Chuck started feeling ill on Oct. 2nd and tested positive for Covid on Oct. 4th. His symptoms started getting worse as each day passed and he was admitted into the hospital on Oct. 15th. Since that time he has been transported to the main hospital and is currently in neuro-icu and the doctors are now treating him for Diabetic Ketoacidosis and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Gbs is where your body’s immune system attacks your nervous system. This started out affecting his feet and legs causing weakness where he can’t stand or walk on his own, moved on to his hands, but now has affected his face and his breathing. He has some paralysis in his face affecting his vision and is having trouble swallowing. It has moved into his breathing where he is now on oxygen. Last night he was placed on a feeding tube. Chuck is now considered Post-Covid so my mom and I were allowed to go in and see him. The dr. said they were walking a fine line with the oxygen mask and if it continued to work he would continue with the mask and if not, he would have to get a breathing tube put in place. My brother has a very long road ahead to recovery.  He celebrated his one year anniversary to his wife Nadine just this past Sunday and they share a home with two of their boys. Chuck is loved by all and he knows no stranger.  Chuck hasn’t been able to work and there is no timeline of when he will be able to return to work.  His sick pay is half of what he typically makes for his family. He really needs our help right now and his focus needs to be on getting better and coming home to his family. My focus is to make sure that his financial needs are met and taken care of, so he doesn’t have to worry. Please continue to pray for my brother and for our family. Much Love, Jenn ",9172,25000,20-Oct-21

Medical Relief Fund for our sweet beautiful sister Bridgette Marie Garcia The GARCIA FAMILY and close friends are calling all friends, family and well wishers far and wide to help support BRIDGETTE MARIE during this terrible health crisis she has been struck with. About a year and a half ago she was experiencing difficulty walking. After extensive testing looking for the cause of her handicap she was diagnosed with ALS ( Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease ). She refused to accept that. Surely there must be another explanation! This began her very disciplined healing journey to detox her body and seek an alternative cure. She sought out countless expensive tests from functional medicine, holistic practitioners, herbal and nutritional experts etc…. But her condition never improved. It continued to worsen. So in March 2021 her loving husband CarloMario was forced to quit his job to care for her full time. But the bills never quit. The house has gone through many needed ADA/ handicap compliant upgrades for accessibility. More out of pocket expenses increased . It seems as if every week there is a need for new equipment and supplies to keep up with this fast moving and debilitating disease. Your contribution will be used towards paying past and current medical bills and the necessary supplies and equipment needed to keep up with and help improve her precious quality of life. Thanks so much to everyone for your much needed support! This life altering illness has been deeply devastating for our entire family. We humbly accept any and all financial and or prayer support to aid Marie during this difficult time. She has exhibited immense bravery in facing this disease and sends her deep love and appreciation for all your support. MANY MANY THANKS! ",24918,50000,29-Aug-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-chris-mcgee-heal,Help Chris McGee Heal," As many of you know, Chris has suffered from Type 1 diabetes stemming from a head injury in 2004. Due to complications from diabetes, Chris has been hospitalized since the beginning of September. He has been on life support for congestive heart failure, kidney failure, pneumonia, blood clots, and a still unknown respiratory disease. Because he has been in the hospital and unable to pay his rent, he has been evicted from his home. His building also has towed his truck that has now accrued such large impound fees, he will not be able to get it back. When Chris is released from the ICU, he will need to find new housing that will be able to accommodate his physical limitations. He will also need a full time home health aide to help him with his recovery and daily needs. He does not have health insurance, so every little bit will help Chris. He has made some improvements but still has a long road of healing ahead. He will still need oxygen 24/7. He will also need a lot of physical therapy before he can return to work. Chris is strong willed, and he will ""shake it off""! Any donation of any amount will be greatly appreciated! ",3920,15000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-abeer-allen,Help Abeer Srouji Allen,"Kristin Hollis is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Abeer Allen. In June of this year (2021), Abeer thought she had bumped her leg without realizing it because she had a mild nagging pain in her thigh. Two months later, that ""injury"" turned into the diagnosis of hi- grade Pleomorphic Leiomyosarcoma, a very rare, very aggressive cancer. The rarity of this cancer type is problematic  because few oncologists have seen a case.   It's so aggressive that a mild pain in June is now a stage 3 sarcoma in September and still growing. She's started radiation and is facing chemo, but she really needs to see an out-of-state specialist that her insurance company keeps denying her access to. The hardest part is to see her in almost constant excruciating pain. The sarcoma is larger than a softball on her right thigh, and it is pressing on nerves resulting in pain that is unbearable. Her mobility is declining, and she is practically homebound.  I picture Abeer as a vibrant, outgoing, funny, friendly, active social butterfly, and it's hard to see this take her down.  Putting a price tag on all of this is impossible.  I am hoping that as a community, we can come together for Abeer and remove financial worries from her, so she can focus on fighting this disease.  Incidentally, she co-owns an Event Planning business that was leveled for a year with Covid cancellations, and those of you who were looking forward to the Conference for Women in October know that she's now had to cancel upcoming events, resulting in loss of her income.   I've joked with Abeer that she has many best friends, and in truth, I'm lucky to be one of them. I've called her mine for 27 years. She is always looking for ways to help people and creatively solve their problems. It's impossible for me to identify everything she has done for the community around her, through her personal life and her business. I can say that when the chips were down in my life and I wasn't really sure where to turn, she was there for me in a way I never expected. She loaned me her car when mine died on the highway, offered me a home when I needed one, and encouraged me not to give up when I thought my life was over. Things change, and now Abeer needs more help than any one person can give her.   If we band together, maybe we can make a difference. Please show your support by making a donation of any amount for her to use toward medical bills, home modifications, and anything else she and her family needs to get through this.  Thank you in advance for your generosity. ",17882,20000,17-Sep-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-makayla-get-painrelieving-surgery,Help Makayla Get Pain-Relieving Surgery," Hi, my name is Makayla and I am fundraising for a surgery to remove a painful ovarian cyst. I get ovarian cysts frequently, and have dealt with intensely painful menstrual cycles for most of my adult life; this cyst in particular is causing quite a bit of trouble. It is attached to my left ovary, and over the last several months has grown to roughly the size of a lime (5cm). Currently, I experience daily, excessive amounts of pain and discomfort in my pelvis. I spend most of my day in bed on a heating pad, and my quality of life has decreased significantly. I am no stranger to pain, as I live with several chronic health conditions (migraine, urinary frequency issues, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, peripheral neuropathy, and chronic pain of unknown etymology). This cyst’s persistent presence is making management of my ever-present daily pain much more difficult. This cyst removal surgery will not only relieve my pain and discomfort, but may also provide long-awaited diagnostic answers about a suspected condition called endometriosis. This diagnosis will support me in creating a treatment plan to prevent situations like this from reoccurring. The fundraising goal is the cost of my insurance deductible that I am responsible for paying out of pocket prior to getting this surgery. I need to pay $730 at my pre-op appointment alone…the rest will go toward surgery costs due the day of, and hopefully I can make a payment plan for the remaining balance. As I am currently on Medical Disability Leave from work, I have a very small stream of income, and gathering this amount of funds in a short amount of time is impossible for me. I am not in any imminent danger, but the longer this cyst remains in my body, the more it will grow and continue causing me pain. My hope is to alleviate even a little of the financial burden so I can schedule surgery soon, get some diagnostic answers, and achieve some much needed pain relief. If you feel compelled to donate, I would be so incredibly grateful. If you cannot donate, I would appreciate if you shared this page so help me get the word out! Thank you all so much for considering helping me out in a tough time. Lots of love, Makayla ",3155,2000,2 days

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-destin-with-medical-expenses,Love & Support for Destin T.," Destin, a beloved son, friend, and father, unexpectedly became ill with a severe blood infection that has led to sepsis and now hospitalization. The infection is viscously attacking his vital organs, so time is critical.  If you personally know Destin, you know that he is one of the most selfless people in this entire world. What he is having to endure is so unfortunate, and so unfair. His journey to recovery has been a continuous battle that he's fighting hard to overcome. Destin specializes in offshore work and is, too often, away from his family. During his recent withdrawal from his current place of work, and in hopes of returning at the beginning of the year for a better opportunity, has left him without medical insurance coverage. In efforts to help Destin on his path to recovery, the Tillman family simply cannot do this alone. Donations are tremendously appreciated, however, if dollar donations are unsuitable for you at this time, his mother, Pam, and his father, Ron, would love your constant prayers and support for their son.>> I'll try my best to provide updates as they are available to me.Current update per Pam, 10/21 -- ""Destin has improved where the liver enzymes are concerned but he's bleeding internally somewhere...we are still waiting for an MRI. He received a blood transfusion this morning but shortly after it started he got double vision and started hallucinating again. The Dr's know definitely the bacteria that got in his bloodstream, I can't remember the name, but the Dr's are aggressively treating it. Destin was starting to go into Septic shock by the time he got to the hospital last week. We are being slammed with tons of information but we are strong and will get through this. I want to let everyone know how much me, Ron Tillman , and Destin appreciate everyone's love, support and prayers.

As I sit here and write this, I am thinking of all ways that I could possibly describe Daniel Goodwin... Genuine, Faithful, Admirable, Encouraging, Kind, Thoughtful, Dedicated, Loyal, Hardworking, Selfless… the list could go on and on. When I think of Daniel, the only true phrase that does him justice... “A Blessing.”  Not only a loving husband, a strong father to 4 beautiful children…but a friend, a brother, an uncle, a son, a leader, a light, a faithful Child of God. Daniel Goodwin is many things but “a blessing” just seems to fit the mold in the best way possible. To know Daniel, is to Love Daniel. If you have not had the privilege to meet Daniel then let me tell you what an absolute light he is in this world. A Godly man that would go out of his way to help someone. A pure representation of Hope in a world that can be so volatile, a man that even on his worst day is better than most of us on our best. Daniel Goodwin is a truly good man. In the very early hours of Monday, August 30th, Daniel was admitted to Mercy Gilbert Hospital with multiple health complications. Since then, his health has continued to decline. His wife, Sarah, has spent more hours than we can count at his side as he battles through this Chapter. Sarah and Close Friends have made it a point to stay on top of updates through the following website: https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/danielsarahgoodwin/journal so that friends, family, loved ones or even complete strangers could stay up to date on Daniel’s Journey. It does not feel real to sit here and type out these words, but the complete and devastating truth is, Daniel is fighting for his life. So many people have helped already, but I am asking for more. This fund is set up to help eliminate some of the financial burden that will be put in front of the Goodwin Family while Daniel fights. By the Grace of God, Daniel and his family have been given another day today. This fund is setup to help support his wonderful wife Sarah, and their 4 beautiful children Ivy (4), Emma (8), Jacob (10), Addison (12) as they navigate this Journey that God has set for them. If you are not able to donate, then please pray. Pray for strength for the entirety of The Gooodwin Family. Pray for Peace and Understanding as God puts his hands on Daniel through this unimaginable time. Pray for anything and everything you can. We know that God has complete control of this and as we put full faith in him, we ask that others do the same. Thank you - Caroline Roberts ",21558,25000,23-Sep-21

""Lesions on your liver"".Time stops and you enter a confused state of mind.Fast forward two days and you hear the Doctor say, ""small cell carcinoma"".  Time stops again.""What?"" "" What are you talking about?""  ""What did you say?""You see, this isn't happening to a 65 year old who has smoked for 30+ years.No.It's Autumn, my 18 year old daughter.  Do you have kids?Go hug them.  Right now. I mean it.  Tell them how much you love them and appreciate them.My daughter literally had a stomach ache for about a week, which isn't really alarming considering she just started college.It got worse, there was some vomiting and a trip to the E.R. sounded prudent. Little did we know how that night was about to turn our lives totally upside down.This is Autumn's story up to this point. She is 18 years old and just three weeks into her  first year of college, everything is, by all means, fine and well, you’re making new friends, starting your classes, learning your way around campus, you make the college volleyball team. Then, out of nowhere, you are diagnosed with an extremely, extremely rare form of cancer. Completely out of nowhere. This is what happened to Autumn. Like I said before, the only symptoms were a stomach ache for a little over a week and vomiting once or twice during that time. Not unusual for a young woman off to her first year of college and all of the pressures that entails. Apparently, this type of cancer is one which is typically seen in smokers of 30+ years. Small Cell Carcinoma and they’ve said she has symptoms of stage 4. Autumn has never, ever smoked or been around people who smoke. The Oncologist stated that he has never seen it in anyone under 35 years old and it is very, very rare. Autumn said, “I’m very rare”! Yes indeed you are Autumn. And rare people like you need to be around for a long time to brighten people’s lives and put a smile on their faces. Something you’ve been doing your whole life. Autumn’s first Oncology appointment was on  September 28th, 2021 at U of M Mott Hospital. The doctors did not provide any answers, only more questions.  They ordered a CT scan immediately and results are awaiting.  A PET Scan is scheduled for Friday, October 1st. So, no definitive results yet and no strategy treatment plan in place yet. What we do know, right now, is that it will be a journey using a multi pronged approach utilizing modern western medicine and Eastern medicine along with a focus on spirit and mind. Updates will be provided once we know the exact details. It’s expected that treatment, care and support will be an instrumental part in Autumn’s plan to health.  Support to help alleviate and cover the already mounting medical expenses, time off work, transportation costs and the additional drugs and therapies not covered by insurance are what is needed immediately. Many, many of you have asked how you can help. Alleviating the additional financial stresses are the best way possible as this will allow focus on care, attention, emotional and physical support of Autumn. Please share this fundraiser with others and donate as generously as you can. ",30052,80000,28-Sep-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/landons-battle,Landon's Battle,"Team fundraiserSarah Hughes and 3 others are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Felicia Meaux. This journey for Landon began by what was believed to be a bad case of strep. His lymph nodes were super swollen and his strep test was positive. After being on antibiotics for 9 days they were convinced he was having an allergic reaction due to how badly his face was swelling when he would wake up. It had done that for 3 days, but on that particular day the swelling did not subside. They revisited the pediatrician's office and were sent to Hamilton for bloodwork and a chest X-ray. While at Hamilton his mom received a call telling them to come back to the pediatrician's office once they left the hospital. They went straight back to the room they had been seen in and at that point were told it was out of their realm of expertise and to head straight to TC Thompson Childrens Hospital. After more tests had been done they recieved the news we had all been praying not hear. Landon has Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, also known as ALL, in his T cells. TC Thompson is now home for at least the next month. He has a long, tough journey ahead to battle this disease that has taken residence in his body. He has already been through a bone marrow aspiration, spinal tap, platelet transfusion, blood transfusions and tolerated his first two rounds of chemo like a champ! Once he is able to go home he will continue treatment, with possible week long stays, at the hospital. It's unknown exactly how long he will need to continue treatment, but they have said it could be for the next 3 years. Landon is such a strong, but sweet young man with the biggest, softest heart. We have so much faith that the Lord has mighty big plans for his life. That being said we already know that they have to pay $10,000 out of pocket for deductible and that doesn't include any medications he receives. Many of you have asked how you can help him and his parents during this difficult transition from their normal everyday life to life battling Leukemia for the unforeseeable future. Your prayers for strength, comfort and complete healing are desired first and foremost and any amount you may feel lead to donate during this new journey through the unknowns will be so helpful and appreciated.

Matthew was transported from the accident scene in Accokeek, MD via medevac (helicopter) to MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, DC.  After 9 months of Matthew being on a neuro floor, enduring numerous surgeries, stays in/out of ICU, missed holidays with family, missed high-school graduation, missed 18th-birthday celebration, and many other significant events, Caroline has made a life-changing decision to bring Matthew home, and not place him in a nursing facility. While the country is moving toward herd immunity, nursing home restrictions would pose a challenge for visitation. Caroline has been by his side every day since the accident occurred. She has advocated for her son’s life and care during his extended stay in the hospital; therefore, putting him in a nursing home was unthinkable because Matthew cannot communicate pain, discomfort or neglect. While this decision was difficult, she, I can attest to, did not enter into it without much prayer and a clear vision; she’s at peace with her decision. Matthew is currently breathing on his own with the aid of NO apparatus-Praise Jesus! God’s hand is ever present over Matthew, which is evident in the attached collage behind the photo tab. Team Jones, as Caroline refers to herself and Matthew, will prevail by God’s Grace and Mercy! She is trusting and pushing, as some of you have witnessed. While she awaits various funding streams on both the State and Federal levels, she must self-fund care, which in Matthew’s current state is required 24/7. On behalf of Team Jones, I am requesting assist with fundraising a goal of at least 3-months of home-skilled care. On behalf of Team Jones, stay well, be safe!

Friends, family, residents of the Susquehanna Valley and beyond, today we're reaching out to ask for your help. Six weeks ago, Eric Dandes suffered a perforated colon and bleeding ulcer, which resulted in life-threatening peritonitis. Surgeons at Evangelical Community Hospital performed an emergency colectomy, removing the entire colon, resulting in the need for an ileostomy. A beloved husband, father, and veteran, Eric is a kind soul, never unwilling to go above and beyond to help those in need. As a long-time reporter for the Daily Item, Eric is known for his work with veterans, firefighters, law enforcement, local shelters, educational institutions and many other worthy causes. Subsequent to his surgery Eric suffered a series of four mini-strokes and spent ten days in the Intensive Care Unit before being moved to Intermediate Care for a further two weeks. Working with physical, occupational and speech therapists, dieticians and wound specialists Eric was deemed fit for transfer to Inpatient Physical Therapy. Unfortunately while in Physical Therapy he developed an infection and became tachycardic, resulting in him spending a further week and a half in the Acute Care unit. Two days ago Eric was once again transferred to Physical Therapy, where he will spend approximately two weeks recovering with the ultimate goal of attending an outpatient facility. We’re asking today for your help in supporting Eric and his family, through this tremendously difficult time. Unfortunately, since being in hospital Eric was placed on medical leave from the Daily Item, resulting in total loss of income. At the same time, he is still obliged to pay the $900 per month cost of health and life-insurance that would normally be covered by his salary. We have exhausted all of our savings, our resources, and whatever we had on hand, and are now turning to you for assistance. We need help paying for: Eric’s surgery and recovery time at Evangelical Community Hospital. Any time spent in an outpatient facility for physical therapy. Ostomy supplies and other medical needs, including visiting nurses, going forward. And lastly, we need your help filling in the gaps that the loss of several months income will mean for his family. We know we're asking a lot, but if you can't ask your family, friends and community for help, who can you ask? You never think it will happen to you until it does. The best and most direct help you can provide, is through this GoFundme. If Eric’s kindness, his enthusiasm, dedication, or his efforts on behalf of your cause have ever touched you, please consider reflecting that back to him in his time of need. Please share and signal boost this GoFundMe as much as you are able - Every dollar helps. With our most sincere thanks, The Dandes Family ",18115,60000,13-Aug-21

She was diagnosed with stage three advanced ovarian cancer that's also spread to her stomach.  For those of you who know her, you know that she is an amazing selfless loving human being. Who has always been there for her friends and family. To us she's more then just a sister or a friend, She took her brother in when he was 16 and she was only 21 and she sacrificed her space, time and daily life to help raise him. That is a testament to the person she is.  Jen underwent a massive surgery this past may to remove the cancer that riddled her body. For nine hours she was under while they completed a full hysterectomy and removal of the cancerous tumors where they also had to reconstruct her bowel. The surgery took a tremendous toll on her body that landed her back in the hospital where she went septic and almost lost her life.  Recent scans show more potential cancer. As scary as this is we remain positive and loving as she fights every day. Because of this she is unable to work and to help provide for her three young children. Disability from work has run out and the hospital bills and treatments pile up.  Jen is the most selfless loving person we know and now is the time where we all give some of that love and selflessness back to her and her beautiful family.

The amount set by the medical staff is between $5,000-$8,000, but I believe we can reach $7,000 is no time. God breaths life into every human on earth. I believe that God can move and provide a miracle in Tammy’s life. We ask that anyone reading this knows how much Tammy is loved and cherished. She has had a long battle ahead, but we (her family) trust in a loving, omnipotent God that cannot be shaken; He will hold her and her needs through this battle. If you have questions please reach out to me( Emily, daughter-in-law) or Tammy’s son, Casey. We appreciate all the love and support. We sincerely covet prayers through this process.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-patricia-with-medical-and-funeral-expenses,Help Patricia with Medical and Funeral Expenses," Hi, I am Terri with Ukulele Unite in Port Townsend WA, and we are raising funds to help Patricia until she can get back on her feet. This year has been very difficult for Patricia so we are organizing the “With a Little Help from My Friends” fundraiser to see her through the next few months. Here at Ukuleles Unite in Port Townsend she has been an inspiration for years. Nobody does so much so cheerfully including all our baffling “tech work”. She is so cheerful and fearless! Patricia is one of those people who connects with others and brings sunshine into their lives. She helps people find their joy in the little things and encourages them to stretch just a little beyond their ""normal"" so they can discover how to live richer and happier in the now. Over the past few years, Patricia’s husband Don developed Alzheimers and declined rapidly this year. She was able to keep him home until this summer when she found him a place in a wonderful memory care center. After he settled in, Patricia learned that she had an aggressive basal cell carcinoma on her face and needed immediate surgery. Her surgery was delayed because Don got Covid and died in September. Patricia had major surgeries on her face in October and will be having more surgeries in November and December. Her recovery will take a few more months. Her finances will take much longer to recover because of her husband's medical and funeral expenses and now her own expenses. She will be unable to work for the next few months, nor can she wear glasses, read or drive. She is self employed as a mental health counselor specializing in trauma so there is no sick leave or safety net. She is getting some help from people providing meals, driving her and walking her beloved dogs. Patricia's positive attitude, especially now during these challenging times, is  an inspiration to all of us witnessing her! We are hoping to raise $10,000 to help her meet her expenses and get back on her feet. Can you help her through this difficult time? Anything you can give would be a godsend for her. Thank you !

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-jacob-frank-with-his-heart-transplant,Help Jacob Frank With His Heart Transplant," Jacob Frank is an extraordinary fun-loving teenager who was born with a congenital heart defect and has been through more in his 14 years than most grown adults I know. With 3 open-heart surgeries since he was 2 days old, he has never let it hold him back from doing his very best in everything he does. He’s the most compassionate individual, strongest, most head-strong teenager I know and has been battling hard every day of his entire 14 years of life to try and keep up with his peers and get through the trials and tribulations that have been tossed in front of him on his journey of life! 2021 was especially difficult for Jacob as he was dealt a life changing event when he experienced an embolic stroke following a heart cath surgery. He had many scary and heart wrenching complications during his 6 week hospital stay ranging from pneumonia to fluid build up outside of his left lung which left him extremely weak upon returning home for further recovery. He has been working extremely hard with his PT, OT & speech therapy ever since returning home. Upon getting back to a semi-recovered state several months later, we went back to Jacob’s cardiologist to address the original issue we had gone in for which was his leaky heart valve and overall enlarged heart which had gotten larger since his last echocardiogram. Jacob’s hypo-plastic left heart condition has left him with a single left ventricle and after much consideration about the risks of repair vs transplant, we consulted with a large team of doctors of all various types to come to the conclusion that Jacob is eligible for and would benefit greatly from a heart transplant. Our family was initially devastated with the news of a recommended heart transplant, but Jacob and his family are all fighters and don't back down for a chance to do the hard and difficult things in life. After the initial shock wore off, we are all ready for the challenge. We have already been through a lot by living at Randall's Children's hospital for 6 weeks earlier this year, but we can and will accomplish anything we put our minds to!!! We are getting more and more prepared for the upcoming challenges immediately following the transplant as well how much our lives will change afterwards. We will also need to be near by the Seattle area especially post surgery, so planning for accommodations will be challenging to say the least when there is no scheduling for a heart transplant when exactly it will be taking place. One of Jacob's biggest thrills in life is watching and playing basketball (when he has the energy). Jacob is the biggest Portland Trailblazers fan and although he was able to see the Blazers play in 2019, he would love the opportunity to meet his NBA Hero, Damian Lillard!!! Jacob loves to watch Dame's appearance on the latest Space Jam: A New Legacy movie playing Chronos. He loves Dame despite being a part of the goon squad. The Dame Dolla songs on the Space Jam: A New Legacy movie soundtrack are a favorite and on repeat when Jacob has control of the tunes. There isn't a thing Dame could do that would deter Jacob from being his biggest fan. We are fundraising to help with all the extra and additional costs we will be incurring by traveling to Seattle Children's Hospital frequently pre and post-transplant that are not covered by insurance. He also needs additional PT, OT & speech therapy since insurance benefits have run out for this year. Any little bit helps and would be much appreciated!!! Thanks, Dave Frank (Jacob's father) ",5840,10000,4 days

Grace Pitts, a 16 year old Junior at JHS, was in a car accident two weeks ago that shattered her L3 vertebrae.  She had emergency surgery at the NN Riverside and stayed for about 9 days.  Despite her drive and determination and the best efforts of the incredible staff there, Grace needed therapy that couldn't be provided locally.  This past Tuesday, she and her mom boarded a private medical flight to be transferred to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, GA for an extensive rehabilitation program lasting 4-6 weeks in duration (followed by more to be done at home upon their return).  Initially, the flight wasn't going to be covered by insurance and whether it will or not remains to be seen.  Now, the family finds out insurance will likely only pay for one week at the Shepherd Center but they are projected to be there for at least one month.  Grace NEEDS this rehabilitation with the experts to learn to use her leg again and the last thing the family needs to be concerned with is finances.  The Pitts do for others in our community all the time.  Now it's our turn to support them.   Grace is an honor student who participates in Key Club (community service club), Gang Green, Spanish Club, and the English Honor Society.  She is also an avid piano player, Girl Scout Ambassador having earned both her Bronze and Silver Awards, and Fife and Drum Junior Corp Alumni.  She's brilliant, kind, and beautiful - inside and out.

Tomás Palacios, de Caracas, Venezuela, fue diagnosticado con cáncer de próstata con metástasis ósea y por esta condición, además de someterse a múltiples sesiones de radioterapia, debe tomar por un tiempo prolongado distintos medicamentos que son bastante costosos. Lamentablemente, nuestros propios recursos económicos son insuficientes para afrontar esos costos y los profesores universitarios, al igual que muchísimos venezolanos, no cuentan con el respaldo de un sistema de seguridad social al cual acudir en una situación tan dramática. Esta es la razón que nos ha forzado a acudir a solicitar ayuda pública y la campaña que estamos lanzando es precisamente para cubrir el costo de la radioterapia y de los medicamentos por tanto tiempo como sea posible. De acuerdo con los médicos que lo han atendido, los pacientes con su patología tienen una sobrevida prolongada siempre y cuando reciban tratamiento adecuado y a tiempo. Por favor, si estás en capacidad de contribuir con esta campaña para que nuestro padre pueda costear su atención médica, sobrevivir al cáncer y reestablecer su salud te estaremos eternamente agradecidos. Cualquier aporte económico por modesto que sea, así como la difusión de esta petición, serán de enorme e invalorable ayuda. ¡Muchas gracias! -----------Hi, we are Mario and Rodrigo. Recently, our dad, Prof. Tomás Palacios, from Caracas, Venezuela, was diagnosed with prostate cancer with bone metastasis. In order to win this fight against cancer, he has to receive multiple sessions of radiotherapy and take meds for a long period of time. This treatment and the meds are very costly. Unfortunately, our resources are not enough to cover these expenses and the University Professors in Venezuela, as many other Venezuelans, don’t have the support from a health care system that allows them to cover the expenses required to deal with an illness as this one. This is the reason why we are asking help to the public and have created this campaign to collect the funds that will help him to cover the cost of the radiotherapy and the meds for the treatment. According to the doctors that examined him, other patients with similar cases have a prognosis with a high success rate if the right treatment is applied on time. If you have the means to contribute to this campaign please do so, this will help our dad to cover his medical expenses. Any economic contribution will help, not matter how small. Please share this petition as well. We will be very thankful! Thanks a lot! ",4675,15000,20-Oct-21

En el caso de Claudia, la quimioterapia no es suficiente para vencer esta enfermedad y por eso ella hoy necesita de tu ayuda. El tipo de cáncer que ella tiene es raro, tanto así que el tratamiento recomendado por su doctor para anular la alteración genética en su pulmón, es el uso del fármaco Nepotinib que cuesta miles de dólares mensuales por un tiempo no especificado. Dado el estado avanzado de su patología, este tratamiento es la única alternativa que le permitirá sobrevivir. Claudia es nativa de Lima, tiene 42 años de edad. Ella estudió comunicación en la Universidad de Lima y posee una maestría en la Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona. En el año 2017 su madre se enfermó y falleció al contraer una neumonía intrahospitalaria, aquello la dejó muy devastada. Luego decidió mudarse a Buenos Aires a vivir con su pareja. Siempre ha mantenido una vida saludable, no fuma, le gusta mucho caminar y sobre todo, pasar tiempo con su familia. Realmente quisiera tener la oportunidad de acceder a este tratamiento, pero el tiempo le juega en contra. Esta enfermedad se manifestó a fines de marzo, con una tos seca y fiebres por las noches, los doctores pensaron que era algo viral relacionado al Covid-19, pero pasó el tiempo y al fin fue diagnosticada con cáncer de pulmón en estadio IV. Hoy ella se encuentra en su ciudad natal Lima (Perú), pero lamentablemente el sistema sanitario no ofrece la medicación que ella necesita para prolongar su vida. Para Claudia es muy importante acceder a este tratamiento porque la va a permitir seguir amando y dando todo a sus seres queridos, ella tiene esperanzas en la solidaridad de las personas que puedan colaborar en su lucha contra el cáncer. MORE LIFE FOR CLAUDIA Claudia has been diagnosed with Non-small cell lung cancer, bone and left adrenal gland metastases. Chemotherapy is not enough to beat her illness. Because of this, Claudia needs your help. Claudia has been diagnosed with a very uncommon type of cancer, and the treatment recommended by her doctor is the use of Nepotinib, which costs several thousand dollars a month. The length of her treatment is still undetermined. Since the illness is advanced, this treatment is the only alternative that will allow her to survive. Claudia studied communication at the University of Lima and obtained a Master's degree at the University of Barcelona. In 2017 her mom got sick and later passed away from pneumonia which she contracted in the hospital. This event devastated her. She then moved to Buenos Aires to live with her partner. She has always maintained a healthy lifestyle. Claudia has never smoked, likes going for walks, and more than anything, she loves spending time with her family. She wants to have the opportunity to access this treatment but cannot wait too long. The illness started in late March. She had a dry cough and fever during the night. Initially, her doctors thought it was something viral related to Covid-19 but later she was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer . Today she is in her hometown Lima (Peru). Unfortunately, the healthcare system does not provide the medication she needs to extend her life expectancy. Claudia needs to receive this treatment because it will allow her to keep loving her family and friends. She has hope that people will have solidarity and help her during her battle against cancer.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-lil-tommy-recover-from-hit-and-run-tragedy,Help Lil Tommy recover from Hit and Run tragedy," On Thursday, September 23, 2021, Tommy Trujillo Jr. was walking in his hometown of Turlock, Ca. when he was struck by a van. He was the victim of a hit and run. Witnesses immediately reported the incident to the local police department and they responded, as well as the fire department and paramedics. (Thank you God for our first responders and may they always be blessed.) Little Tommy, as he is fondly called by family members, was unconscious and badly injured. He suffered severe head trauma and a broken leg. He was transported to Doctor’s Hospital in Modesto, Ca. Fortunately, Doctor’s Hospital is a renowned neurological medical facility. He was placed on life support and a ventilator to breathe. Upon hearing the news, the Trujillo family was obviously devastated. The initial prognosis was grim, but we have great FAITH in our Lord Jesus Christ and together with our large family and many friends, we asked God for a miracle. And HE delivered! As his Great Grandmother Eloisa would often say, “Thank you Baby Jesus.” Little Tommy is the first born child to Tommy Trujillo Sr. and Debbie Trujillo. He is also the first born Grandchild to Tony and Carmen Trujillo and he is their pride and joy. Little Tommy is very intelligent and musically inclined. He continued taking college courses and loved to learn. At a young age, he taught himself to play the guitar by practicing on his Grandpa Tony’s guitar. He was an avid music listener and eventually formed a band called “The Reignsmen.” He is a talented musician and his family has great pride in his accomplishments. Little Tommy is a simple guy and loves his family and friends. He has a great sense of humor and an adventurous spirit. His Grandpa Tony said it best, “Little Tommy is the kind of person who NEVER has a bad thing to say about anyone.” And this is so true. With the current state of affairs in this country, we could all learn from Little Tommy. As previously stated, we have all been blessed with a miracle. After a month in the hospital, Little Tommy is now beginning to talk, feed himself and just a couple of days ago, walked several steps with the assistance of a physical therapist. The medical staff (TRUE HEROES) are amazed at all of his accomplishments in such a short period of time. His family is too. We are truly blessed as a family and God has given Little Tommy a second chance at life. Over the next several months, Little Tommy will continue to have many physical challenges, but he is a survivor and a fighter. With the Grace of God and FAITH, he will continue to get better. With additional medical costs, outside of his medical insurance and the inability to work, he will need financial assistance. We are asking our family and friends to help Little Tommy, so he can focus on his health and have peace of mind while he heals. ❤️ Love, The Trujillo Family ",8850,15000,5 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-ashley-salomon-through-her-ms,Support Ashley Salomon through her MS," My name is Ashley Salomon and I'm fund raising to cover the mounting medical expenses and to make ends meet while I'm unable to work and on the mend. I was a practicing Chiropractic Physician in Wellington at Max Health Chiropractic until my vision became so sever that I could no longer see to drive. There was a rapid progression of relentless, incapacitating headaches, disorientation/feeling like being in the ""twilight hour"", confusion, severe forgetfulness, dizziness, severe heat waves, select muscle/mental/whole body fatigue, painful strobes/flashes in my vision, impaired critical thinking/problem solving, not perceiving what I was seeing, swallowing difficulties, etc. Upon seeing the neurologist, he was emphatic about the severity of my case. I've already had 3 MRIs, a dozen office/specialists visits, a dozen labs, over a dozen supplements for deficiencies which has already cost $4,000, and 3/4 of the lab statements haven't even come through yet. There have been more questions and no good answer for beginning real treatment. The supplements have mostly resolved the vision loss and bad headaches, but there is still much more ahead. While this has been difficult, I am far from hopeless. I cannot express my gratitude for the outpouring of love, support, and encouragement from everyone. I am hopeful to eventually return to taking care of my patients whom I love dearly as well as returning in ministry at Christ Fellowship. In the meantime, while I am limited in what I can do, I have been spending more time with God and developing a deeper relationship with Him. I know that God will work in this to use it for greatness. Even if this all happened just that someone might come to know Him and His unbreakable love for them, then I consider it more than worth it. What I most ask for at this time, is for your prayers. If anyone wishes to help financially, too, that would be very helpful as well since there are still more appointments, tests, and prescriptions to come.  I understand that people want to know where their money is going and being used, so this is my OCD breakdown of known November & December expenses (I really hope to be back on my feet by next year) totaling $4,216.20 (this was tallied before the mold/toxicology specialist): Medications/Supplements/Prescriptions: $326.42 Treatment Protocols: $623.81 Specialists/office visits: $1,028.00 Lab work: $747.93 Bare minimum living expenses beyond what my husband's income covers: $1,490.04 UPDATE: As of the appointment with the tox/mold specialist (on 10/27/21), we now have a much better idea of what we're dealing with (it was more substantial than suspected) and how the treatment will be unfolding/progressing (*cheering and jubilee*). Unfortunately, the _six month_ trek will include repeated testing and monitoring the responses to continuously adjust the medications and treatments. Furthermore, I have to see a Neuropsycho specialist for more extensive testing. Today's appointment alone was $1,562 (THANK YOU to those who already contributed and made that payment less horrifying) and there will be a $2,300 comprehensive test this week. Since there will be many more like it through the course of my treatment, I cannot even begin to calculate the projected costs, but I know that it will all be okay.  I greatly thank our friends and family who have been shouldering this burden with us in addition to those covering our travel expenses so that we can enjoy the holidays/ special occasions with you. Special thanks to Judy Jensen, David & Rachel Teitel (Romnosky), Kari Salomon, Jamie Michelle, and Kira Schwab. We love you! ",6600,10000,4 days

She is full of life and with a strong will to live. But for 5 years now, she has lived with pain. She has a very rare condition, she is the only one in Chile who suffers from it. It has no cure and it generates constant chronic neuropathic pain throughout her body. This is due to a venous malformation in her spinal cord (myelopathy due to venous capillary telangiectasia). The pain becomes unbearable so she has to resort to opioid patches that help to reduce the pain a little bit, but at a great cost both physically and mentally. Besides these drugs are extremely expensive. Pamela can't take it anymore; she has lost her ability to walk, every day she has less strength and the pain does not stop, but despite everything, her children give her the strength to fight day by day. Pamela has only a glimmer of hope left. She is a candidate for a surgery whose cost is around $50,000 USD, something unattainable for her who already has a large bank debt due to previous medical procedures. Just to be able to have her diagnosis it took more than 4 years and a large sum of money. Our goal with this campaign is to collect $62,000 USD to cover operating expenses, hospitalization and medications. The surgery consists of the implantation of a Medtronic neurostimulation kit in the spinal cord. Pamela has already lost a lot, her energy, her motor skills, her strength, her home, her smile full of light. Let's not let her loose hope, no one deserves to live like this. The operation would be performed at Clínica Las Condes, the only place in Chile where they can perform it. We must collect the total amount, otherwise the operation cannot be carried out.

However, at an early ultrasound, it was discovered that Baby Cora has Congential Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH ) . The link provides more details, however, it occurs when the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen, fails to close during prenatal development. This opening allows contents of the abdomen (stomach, intestines and/or liver) to migrate into the chest, impacting the growth and development of the lungs.  They have been referred to the #1 facility, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Once Cora is born, she will need surgery immediately. They will need to continue to monitor baby, and due to the extreme medical diagnosis, they will need to relocate to PA for that time.

The tumor is operable, and the doctors are optimistic that 90-95% of if will be removed via surgery. She will then need radiation therapy to prevent reoccurrence, and if cancer is detected chemotherapy as well. Based on her scans the doctors suspect this is not cancerous; however we will not know anything for certain until her surgery which will be Wednesday or Thursday of next week.  What we do know for certain is that Valerie will be out of work for at least a month. and she is not permitted to drive a car for 6 months.

Colby White, son of Michael and Amy and brother to Makenzi and Cameron, was born with MPS (Mucopolysaccharidosis). The White Family has devoted their lives to giving Colby the best care possible.  He has had an umbilical cord transplant which has allowed him to live a happy and healthy life for the last 16 years.   At the beginning of September, Colby started having noticeable changes with his gait and pain. Amy and Michael immediately knew to seek help. Since the beginning of September, Colby has been admitted to Children’s Hospital twice. The latest visit has lasted for several weeks and included a shunt revision for Colby. Since the shunt revision on September 17, Colby has been on the ventilator with two unsuccessful extubation attempts. In the middle of the night on Saturday (9/25), Colby’s endotracheal tube became displaced. This turned into an emergency situation that Amy and MaKenzi were at bedside to witness. Colby was essentially in respiratory arrest and taken to the OR for an emergency tracheostomy. The Whites are desperate for their baby to be independent from the ventilator and with the trach it now makes his recovery an even more extensive and delicate process. Michael and Amy are spending every possible second at Colby’s bedside. This means they are unable to be with MaKenzi and Cameron and also unable to work.

Plans for the future have been put on hold and the uncertainty of what is to come looms over their every decision.Tom and Amy had been working hard over the summer on much needed house repairs. However, in early August, Tom began to feel unwell. This ultimately led to his dire cancer diagnosis. Now, with chemotherapy treatments greatly impacting his ability to work, the repair projects have been left incomplete. Tom has used what time he has had when feeling well to continue the work, rather than spend what precious time he has with his family. Much of the work is no longer safe for him to even be attempting, so we are hoping to ease the burden - and maybe even provide an opportunity for Tom, Amy and their 2 young children to getaway and create some special memories together.Please consider giving financially (no amount is too small.) If a financial gift is not possible currently, we ask that you SHARE this link and information about this fundraiser with others and/or send thoughts/prayers to the West Family. Thank you!Amy has also asked that you educate yourself in the signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer. Because the symptoms often go unnoticed, ignored or dismissed as other ailments, pancreatic cancer is often detected after it has already spread to other organs. Only about 20% catch it soon enough to have it surgically removed.  Please go to www.pancan.org to learn more. Be sure to never dismiss symptoms of persistent indigestion, severe gas, bloating and back pain.  ",4745,25000,6 days

On Sunday, September 26, 2021, Riley and his parents, Rob and Pam Stephens, were involved in a small airplane crash at a private landing strip in Billings, Montana. Rob and Pam did not survive, but Riley made it out of the plane and was rushed to the hospital, where he was life-flighted to Salt Lake City’s University of Utah burn unit, accompanied by his brother, Steele. Riley sustained burns on 70% of his body, The doctors believe his chances of survival are 50/50. He has been sedated to help with his pain. On Monday, September 27, he went in for his first surgical procedure for the debridement of his hands, which sustained the worst damage. He responded well to the procedure. He will likely have more surgeries this week. The family has been advised to take each day as it goes. If he survives this week, he will have a lengthy recovery journey ahead of him (3 months at least). We have gathered with friends and family in SLC to await these important days. Please pray for Riley’s full recovery, physically, mentally, and spiritually. We are asking for donations to help cover medical expenses, travel expenses, accommodation arrangements, and all other necessary expenses for Riley, Steele, and Piper during this time. We appreciate any and all help we can get. We will also be using Caring Bridge to keep people updated with news as we have it. Thank you for keeping Riley, Steele, and Piper in your prayers.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/son-diagnosed-with-rare-aggressive-tumors,Son Diagnosed With Rare Aggressive Tumors,"Team fundraiserChristian Barrett and Thomas Mina are organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Michael Schaaff.In October of 2020, our son, Anthony Schaaff, started experiencing intense pain in his right side. He was hospitalized for a week, and was diagnosed with a kidney tumor which had hemorrhaged. During his time in the hospital he developed sepsis and came close to losing his life. After months of bed rest, in January 2021, he had his tumor surgically removed through open surgery at Weil Cornell in New York City. After his ordeal, and he was fully healed, he moved permanently to Florida as he realized how short life can be and was always happiest down there. Just one month ago, he told his job in NYC that he would not be returning to NYC when the office started reopening post COVID in October. His job agreed to let him work remotely from Florida until February 2022. After that his employment would end. Just two weeks after resigning, Anthony had his follow up catscan per his surgeon. The catscan showed multiple reoccurring tumors on the kidney, adrenal gland, and around the liver. Biopsies showed a rare form of malignancy, angiomylipomas with epithloid cells. Shortly after his diagnosis, Anthony became very ill.  Constant fevers, chills, pain, and extremely low blood counts caused by the multiple tumors. He's fainted twice from low hemoglobin levels and has already required hospitalization and blood transfusions. We've been told by multiple surgeons that surgery is not an option to remove the tumors due to the progression of the disease. He is being treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering in NYC. Doctors are administering immunotherapy treatments every 3 weeks with the hopes of shrinking the tumors so that surgery may be an option. Sloan has told us that his condition is so rare that they have only seen a total of 20 documented cases in the history of the hospital. We do not know how long he will require treatment. It could be 6 months, or it could be 2 years before we see the results where surgery could be an option. During this time he will have costs to travel back and forth to NYC for treatment, home care costs, as well as the many medical costs which are not covered by his insurance. (The catscan which resulted in his diagnosis had to be paid out of pocket as insurance denied him.) In addition, his insurance will end when his employment ends in February, and COBRA costs are astronomical. We are asking for any help that can be offered during this time as we help our son fight for his life. God bless, Michael Schaaff and Mary Ferrera-Bottiglieri",2310,50000,18-Oct-21

Mark was placed on a ventilator at first, but it did not help his lungs so he ended up on an ECMO machine.  After 40 days on the ECMO machine along with the ventilator  with daily highs and lows we are elated to report that Mark is finally off the ECMO but still on ventilator and is starting his long road to recovery. His doctors say it can take 6-10 months for him to make a full recovery and get back to work.  Mark has been the primary income for his family that also includes his 3 sons, Mark Jr, Victor and Matias. Although Pamela has managed to keep their finances afloat during the beginning of his battle, they could now use our help. Anyone that knows Mark and Pam knows they would give the shirt of their back to help anyone. We are asking for your help to get Mark and his family through this very difficult time so they can focus on his road to recovery.

This brought them some much needed financial relief.But, on September 3rd, Cassandra noticed a lump above her collarbone. She shared a picture of it with a friend who suggested she get it checked out immediately. She drove herself to the ER the next morning while Dylan stayed home with the kids.After an X-ray and CT scan, the doctors found a mass in Cassandra’s chest. They believed she might have Lymphoma. She was then transported via ambulance to Shands Cancer Hospital where she would stay for four days.The team of doctors working with her believed she may have stage 2 Lymphoma, but further testing would be needed.After several painful weeks and more tests, Cassandra and her family learned that she has stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma. That means that she has cancer and it has spread.Her doctor told her that stage 4 can be cured, but she is “going to go through hell” as she goes through treatment and “will have to fight for her life.” She was also advised to leave her new job as soon as possible. Cassandra and her family need our help. We need to help them fight this cancer so she can be there for her babies and watch them grow.

My Name is Danielle Rooks (Parpart) I am fundraising for my Precious Nephew, Dakota Parpart. Dakota is an Exceptional young man filled with a love for life and an appreciation for humanity that to few seem to still posses. He will turn 16 on September 4th and is scheduled to begin 11th grade at Yale High School on August 31st. If someone is in need of assistance Dakota would be the first to offer help, if their is a job to be done, without complaint Dakota will begin working on it. He is one who puts his heart into all he chooses to invest his energy into weather family, school, sport’s, or one of his many hobbies like driving truck with his Father Sam, Gardening with his Mother Dawn, or learning something new. Now Dakota and his family are in need of Prayers and Support as he fights for the life he posses here with us. The night of Sunday August 22 Dakota suffered a AVM brain Aneurysm in his home. His Mother was able to get treatment to him in time enough to get him to port Huron ER where he was transferred to Children’s Hospiatal In Detroit @ the ICU. He was and currently remains in a coma on life support. Dakota suffered brain stem damage which brought some question about how to proceed with treatment, however Dakota Miraculously began to respond to medication encouraging the Drs. to perform the initial necessary surgery. Since then Dakota has had an angiogram and MRI that shown the ability to perform a second surgery which was completed yesterday. This surgery lasted 14 hours through which Dakota remained stable allowing further progress to be achieved. Though we are on the right road, shown bright with faith through the Prayers being sent, we know this road is long and Prayers and support are vital throughout this process. It is my desire in creating this gofundme to provide an opportunity to those who are compelled and able to offer monetary support to his parents. These monies will be used to ensure they will be able to be where they need to be and worry only about what matters now; Dakotas Well-being. To secure transportation, maintain household responsibilities, and covering the cost of other expenses that may arise from this life changing experience.

On September 25th, Denise woke up from sleeping to find Lance coughing on the floor of the bathroom. She called 911 and an ambulance transported him to St. Joe's hospital in Burbank. He flatlined on the table but they were able to resuscitate him. Lance had a massive heart attack and was put into a medically induced coma to help stabilize him.  He has since been taken off of the breathing tube but has now suffered a series of silent strokes and an acute stroke. He is awake, but not always lucid and will need extensive rehabilitation. He is currently still hospitalized. When he is eventually released, he will need full time care as he continues recovering.

She is always the one who has gifts, cards and flowers for everyone else, but would never in a million years ask for help. But they need it. This is the time of year when Lance and his business bring our community joy with the incredible lights and decorations he installs around our village. From now until Christmas, Lance is usually hard at work, literally lighting up our streets.  In order to supplement the financial loss from the holiday season and to help with the extensive medical bills that are piling up, we have started this gofundme to help ease their burden and allow them to focus on family.

We are raising funds to help our brother (Albert Lorenzo) in his fight against cancer. Albert was first diagnosed with cancer of the lymph nodes (Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma). He went for 6 cycles of chemotherapy already this year and, with God’s Grace, is now clear from it. However, his fight against cancer did not end there, 2 weeks ago his doctor found out that he has another type of cancer – cancer in his colon (Adenocarcinoma of the colon). His Doctor recommended doing the surgery immediately to avoid further complications.Our family is contributing to fully support him, unfortunately, with the amount we need to pay, we still need help and support from those who can and are able to.Our family funds were exhausted due to the earlier chemotherapy and expenses we paid. Furthermore, his insurance will not cover any other costs this year since he already reached his medical coverage limit for the year. As such, we would appreciate any amount that you can spare. The funds raised here will help Albert focus on his recovery so that he can continue to live his life and take care of his family. His case is becoming urgent and waiting for few more months to get his insurance sorted out might make his cancer worse. Albert works in Singapore with his wife and kids. He is a generally healthy individual and so we are confident that he can make it through this battle. Dealing with the stress of having two different cancers is not easy, emotionally and financially. Although he can still do his day-to-day activities and perform his job, he can't come up with the money for the surgery on short notice.Looking forward to your help and prayers.

Jason Goyea was in a car accident late that afternoon, and the minutes, hours, and days since then have been life changing for him, his family, and his friends. Jason suffered a traumatic brain injury, was put on a ventilator at Alice Hyde and transferred to the intensive care unit at University of Vermont Medical Center in Burlington that evening. He is receiving excellent care and is making great strides in his road to recovery. He was able to be removed from the ventilator and moved out of ICU but remains in the hospital in Vermont. The plan is to eventually move him to inpatient rehabilitation within the hospital so he can begin intensive cognitive therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy to regain any functions he has lost. Anyone that knows Jason, knows what a funny, caring, giving, and independent, man that he is. He has a long road ahead of him and is going to need all of you reading this to help and support him along the way as he recovers from his injuries.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/ebaf3-matts-stroke-recovery,Matt's Stroke Recovery,"Patrick Freivald is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Melissa Rowley. Hi, I'm Patrick Freivald, and I'm fundraising for my best friend, Matt Rowley. Matt, only 48 years old, had a stroke last week that has paralyzed him on the right half of his body, after recovering from Covid this past winter and a heart attack last fall. He has made a little bit of progress but is still in the hospital and still very much paralyzed. This has left him and his family with large (and pending) medical bills, and in the coming weeks and months they will need to pay for additional hospital time, inpatient and outpatient rehab, therapy, medication, plus things that insurance doesn't even touch—a mobility wheelchair, remodeling their home (at least the entryway and bathroom) to accommodate his condition, plus the lost income for himself and his wife Melissa (a nurse). I sat down with Melissa and we think $125,000 is a realistic but possibly conservative amount to cover what they need so that Matt can come home in a few months or a year to something closer to a normal life as a husband, father, grandfather, and dear friend. Fortunately he has better insurance than he did last fall, where the bills for his heart attack were devastating, but that situation has certainly made this one that much more dire. Anything you can give, even just the GoFundMe minimum of $5, will be most appreciated. Every penny will go toward managing Matt's hospitalization, rehabilitation, and to needed upgrades he'll need for the rest of his life. Thank you so much. ",23361,125000,31-Aug-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-support-the-rudenick-family,Help Support the Scott Rudenick Family,"Grommersch   Family is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Julie Rudenick. In August, Scott Rudenick was diagnosed with a fast growing brain tumor (glioblastoma). Scott is not only a loving grandfather, father and husband, but a valued member of the Nicollet community, avid Raider football fan, and our school bus driver. He underwent surgery to remove the cancer, which was 95% successful! Our hearts were crushed two weeks later, when a CT scan presented the tumor had already started to regenerate and that Scott also had a stroke. Unfortunately, insurance has not been on Scott’s side. Lack of coverage has limited access to necessary resources, rehabilitation facilities, specialists, etc. He even had to cancel an oncology appointment due to lack of coverage. This page is designed to assist Scott in gaining access to resources and equipment needed to battle his cancer and improve his quality of life. Support will be used towards his extensive therapy, countless doctor appointments, and to obtain the adaptive equipment required to maneuver within his home. For those of you who know him, you’d agree that he is an extraordinary person with a huge heart. He is a loving family member who is largely involved in the community, true to his faith, and has always put his friends and family before himself. This is truly a “life isn’t fair” situation. We can’t change the diagnosis, but this is one way we can help the Rudenick family through this difficult time. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts. ",51667,45000,1-Oct-21

https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-and-love-for-bonita-raymond,Support and Love for Bonita Raymond,"Samantha Scala is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Bonita Raymond.            As you all know by now, our dear friend Bonita Raymond was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in early August. She is currently in the 6th round of Chemo, and completely taking this on like the warrior we all knew she was! Bonita is not only one of the strongest individuals I know, but also one of the most independent, so asking for help is not something she does well. While she appreciates all the gifts and kind words everyone has already presented, the struggles of dealing with finances, while fighting this battle have been wearing on her and her family. Fortunately enough, she has moved in with her Mom, Iris, along with her son Maddox, and they are taking this cancer head on as a family. Bonita still has many mountains to climb ahead including but not limited to; additional rounds of Chemotherapy, Surgery, and possibly radiation. Her treatment plan will last throughout the next year at least, and could continue longer through the foreseeable future.  Bonita is a single Mom to her beautiful son Maddox currently, and has the desire to have more children, which may mean seeing a fertility doctor in the future, which could also be costly. If you can help, even a little, during this hard time, every little bit counts, and it will be more than appreciated. We will also have Bracelets soon available for purchase to help fundraise for Breast Cancer research as well.  Please continue the thoughtful prayers and kind words, as they are helping tremendously thus far. Thank you in advance for all the continued support throughout the past couple of months, it truly takes a village, and myself, as well of the rest of Bonita’s tribe are so thankful!

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-chris-get-a-new-chair,Help Chris get A New Chair," Hello everyone! I wanted to tell you a bit about my husband. He is an avid hunter/outdoorsman, who goes above and beyond to take care of his family and friends. He’s also a paraplegic. He’s had his power chair (that allows him to get outdoors and work, hunt, and enjoy the things he loves) for going on 14 years. Recently his power chair quit, and needs a new one to be able to continue to do what he loves, and unfortunately insurance won’t pay, or even help pay for a new chair. Anyone who knows Chris, knows he is always on the go, whether it be hunting, fishing, working (goes to work, cuts wood for us for the winter, mows, weedeats, the list goes on). He’s always the person that lends a hand to those who need it, and never asks for anything in return. It breaks my heart to see him so down, and feeling defeated.  I’m asking for him, for those of you who have anything to spare, to please find it in your heart to help him out. Whether it’s a dollar, or a hundred dollars, we would be so grateful.  Thank you all, and God Bless.  ",2820,13000,4 days
https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-janessa-beat-cancer,Help Janessa fight ovarian cancer," Hello, I’m Katie Ellis - one of Janessa’s best friends for more than 20 years. Janessa is a 34-year-old wife and mother to a 2-month-old son who needs our support! She’s currently battling the biggest fight of her life against advanced-stage ovarian cancer, in which symptoms developed rapidly during her pregnancy. She’s bedridden at the moment due to the severity of her condition. She starts six rounds of aggressive chemotherapy tomorrow, as well as 10 rounds of radiation on the top of her legs. If you know Janessa, you know she has the biggest and kindest heart in the world. She’s currently unemployed due to her condition so money raised will help with unforeseen medical bills, a wig for her to wear and necessities to help support Janessa and her family. Updates will be given HERE! As well as her Instagram (janessa_tt). Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your love and support! Here’s her story: “Some of you know me and some of you probably have no idea who I am (hello!), but thank you for reading my story! In October 2012, I had a 9-pound borderline-malignant tumor removed from my right ovary (along with my fallopian tube and appendix). Surgery was able to successfully remove the tumor with no need for treatment (chemotherapy, etc.) I underwent extensive testing biannually for five years - and there was no sign of a recurrence. Fast forward to the end of my 2nd trimester of pregnancy in June 2021, I started experiencing sciatica in both my legs that got worse AND WORSE as time progressed. I told my OB at each appointment about my pain, but I was told the standard line of “that’s pregnancy for you!” I saw a chiropractor on a weekly basis; tried using a weighted blanket, bounced on a yoga ball, lathered my legs in magnesium lotion, made my husband give me massages on a nightly basis - you name it, but nothing helped me. Through my research I learned sciatica disappeared after birth. It was my only saving grace at the time: “The storm will pass!” Shortly after my baby shower, the pain got so much worse that I could barely walk, stand or sit longer than a few minutes. It felt like my legs were being stabbed in the nerves over and over. I clung to over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs for a slight refuge from the pain. I cried EVERY SINGLE day. My primary doctor couldn’t see me for a few weeks (recommended by my OB) so I took matters into my own hands and booked an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon who ordered a MRI. A herniated disc made sense, but the results were beyond what we imagined. Numerous lesions along my spine - top to bottom - as well as two tumors on my pelvic muscles. After several weeks of tests (PET scan, MRI x2, CT scan, ultrasound, bloodwork, three biopsies, etc.), I was referred to an oncologist who gave us the news: You have ovarian cancer. It spread to the bones and muscles in my spine, pelvis and top legs. “It has been growing inside you for years without knowing it,” said my oncologist. There’s no way to be certain, but looks like the tumor from 9 years ago left behind precancerous cells. So, here I go, embarking on the hardest journey of my life! Thank you for reading my story. I love you ALL ❤️“ ",18550,25000,20-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/the-garlands-need-your-help,The Garlands need your help,"Team fundraiserJames Gagnon and Paige Garland are organizing this fundraiser. Hi my name is Jim and I’m fundraising for my nephew Sean. As some of you may know, Sean was admitted to Newton Memorial ICU on Monday September 27th. Very suddenly while at home, Sean became extremely panicked and disoriented. He began gasping for breath and was unable to stand. Upon rushing him to the emergency room, they discovered his blood sugar levels were dangerously high. To help him with breathing he was immediately put on a ventilator and sedated, the sedation was necessary due to Sean trying to pull the ventilator hoses and IV lines out due to his lack of understanding where he was. He remained in the ICU for almost a week as the doctors struggled to get Sean’s blood working for him, not against him. All through the week Sean continued to fight, his dad Brian by his side as best he could, talking to his son, reassuring him they were going to get through this. Although Sean was not conscious, the nurses reassured us he could hear us talking to him. As the days passed, it was determined that Sean was suffering from diabetic keto acidosis, a life threatening complication of diabetes, something Sean had never been diagnosed having. As I write this, Sean is in the very grueling process of healing at the hospital. His heart and kidneys took a large toll during this ordeal and are still in a very weakened state. He has gone through numerous dialysis treatments over the past six days and has shown some signs of improving. The next step of his recovery will require an extended stay at a rehabilitation center as he works at gathering his strength both physically and mentally to face the challenges ahead. The unfortunate reality came later as the specialist treating Sean stated to the family that Sean was now facing living his life with type 1 diabetes at the young age of 24. With your help, we are hoping to alleviate some of the financial burden Sean will be facing. As Sean focuses his attention on healing and learning to cope with his medical condition, any and all donations will go towards his mounting medical bills due to his extended time in the ICU and towards the exceedingly high cost of insulin and other supplies he will need in the future. The love and support Sean and his 3 siblings received after the passing of their mom in 2008 after a long battle with cancer was immeasurable. The outpouring from the community meant the world to the family then, and it will mean the world to them once again. Please keep Sean in your thoughts and thank you for a few moments of your time.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/team-colin,Team Colin,"Jennifer Price is organizing this fundraiser. Hi, my name is Jennifer Price and I want to share the story of my nephew Colin McWilliams. On August 25th, Colin was traveling to football practice at Lincolnway Central High School and was involved in a head-on accident that changed life as we know it. Colin suffered a number of injuries, including a traumatic brain injury from a piece of skull that was embedded in his brain, an open femur compound fracture, and a torn tri-cep. Colin was air-lifted to Loyola Hospital where he underwent a grueling 8-hour surgery to take a piece of skull out of his brain, repair his broken femur, and repair his tri-cep. On September 29th, Colin was transferred to Shirley Ryan Rehabilitation Center. He will require months of extensive rehabilitation for things that once came so easy to him such as eating, walking, and talking. Things that we all take for granted each and every day. In early November, Colin will be transferred back to Loyola Hospital where he will undergo another brain surgery to replace the piece of skull that was removed earlier. He will then return to Shirley Ryan to continue his rehabilitation. The road to recovery is a long journey. Doctors are hoping for a full recovery, but it will take time and intense therapy. Colin is currently responding to therapy and medical intervention. Colin has already conquered the initial battle for his life the past five (5) weeks. This was a tough battle as we were told he may not have made it through the first 24 hours. Colin has always been a fighter, worked extremely hard to compete, and always gives 110%. He has always had the powerful drive to succeed. We are all confident that Colin will continue to have this drive as he goes through the long journey of rehabilitation. Any and all donations received will go directly toward medical costs for Colin and a certain percentage will be donated back to the Ronald McDonald House Charity. Rebecca, Brian and the kids would like to thank everyone for all of the prayers and support they have received from their families and the community. A benefit will be held for Colin on November 13th at Gatto’s Italian Restaurant, 5PM. #Team Colin ",26960,35000,6-Oct-21
https://www.gofundme.com/f/sandys-fight-for-leiomyosarcoma-cancer,Sandy’s fight against Leiomyosarcoma cancer,"Shelby Smith is organizing this fundraiser on behalf of Sandra Smith. Hi all, I’ve decided to put together a GoFundMe  page for my parents. My mom has probably been through one of the worst years of her life. She was diagnosed  in November 2020 with Leiomyosarcoma cancer where they found a tumor in her pathology report. Leiomyosarcoma is an extremely aggressive form of cancer. Her doctor ordered for the tumor to be taken out which consisted of two separate surgery’s. My mom was in remission till the end of June when her six month check up scan showed new tumors in her pelvis, along with lymph node involvement and her lungs. Chemo treatments were recommended immediately. After her third week of chemotherapy she was hospitalized due to allergies to chemo, ascites( fluid ) in the stomach, and caught pneumonia all from Chemotherapy. Her doctor ordered 3 separate blood transfusions as her body was making improper blood with extremely low salt levels. Chemo has come to complete stop. Unfortunately her cancer has grown a lot and now involves most of her abdominal cavity. After spending this past week in the hospital again we are praying Boston will come up with a new treatment plan for her but this all comes with a price. With my mom taking so much time off from work and my dad as well helping her back and forth from the doctors I’ve decided to ask our friends and family for some assistance for medical and living expenses as it’s unclear when she will be able to go back to work. We are meeting with a new specialist Tuesday October 12th and hope to have some more answers. As of right now we are thinking more surgeries are ahead and hope to come up with a new treatment plan to which she is not allergic to. Please know that our family has been very quiet about this. Only extremely close relatives and friends have known. We are extremely thankful to everyone who has helped thus far. Please keep my family in your thoughts and prayers.

I will undergoing a very intensive chemotherapy treatment in the upcoming days which results in me not being able to go to school or work. My mom as well decided to stop working in order for her to take care of me.

https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-emily-gorsky-bonanno-with-medical-bills,Help Emily (Gorsky) Bonanno with medical bills," Hi everyone, most of you know who I am and know that we've been here before, unfortunately. Since receiving her lungs 8 years ago, Emily has had the chance to live a beautiful life. She met Zach, the love of her life, and had her fairytale wedding. She moved to a new apartment and even adopted her new little bestie, Lincoln. On Tuesday, October 19, 2021, Zach came home from work to find Emily stumbling outside as she was walking Lincoln. He called 911 and Em was taken to Morristown Memorial Hospital. After undergoing an MRI which confirmed a severe stroke, she was transferred to New York-Presbyterian to be closer with her team of doctors. She has undergone several tests which have confirmed the size and location of the clot. The family is still waiting to see the long term effects of her stroke. As of Wednesday, October 20, Emily underwent surgery to relieve pressure from the brain. The doctors are concerned about the swelling in her brain but were pleased with how she did during the surgery.  And a bright note - those beautiful lungs she received did a wonderful job.  The bills associated with this stay will be astronomical. This page is just our hope to help her and Zach out with a little piece of it. Once we know a little more, I will be providing updates and will start up a meal train if necessary. Any amount is appreciated, if you can. If you can't, all we ask is that you keep Emily, Zach and their families in your constant prayers. We have seen miracles with this sweet girl in the past and we are so hopeful that we will see more.~There will be no letting go today~  ",13539,15000,20-Oct-21

If you know Jeffrey (Jeff) Milestone, then you know that he is extremely smart, that he has a very good sense of humor (albeit dry at times), and most of all, you know that he is a true and loyal friend. This message is being sent to you either directly because you are someone that Jeff considers to be a good friend; or, you are part of his loving family; or, you have mutual friends with Jeff and they shared this message with you. Unfortunately, Jeff is now in a place where he needs every person he can get to help support him in the fight of his life.   For anyone who does not know what Jeff has been though these past few months, here is the short version which began on January 6, 2021.  Jeff met with a neurologist who suspected there was some type of mass in his brain.  Two MRI’s later, he was diagnosed with a tumor on his brainstem and cerebellum.  He quickly met with a brain surgeon at the University of Miami.  He had brain surgery on January 21st, and only a small amount of the tumor could be removed because the tumor is on and wrapped around his brainstem and cerebellum.  Dr. Komotar was able to remove only enough tissue to be sent to pathology.  Dr. Komotar then introduced a neuro-oncologist (Dr. Maria Prieto) and a radiation oncologist (Dr. Eric Mellon) to Jeff’s team for treatment.  The medical professionals have all been great physicians as well as and extremely caring and supportive people We cannot ask for a better medical team than the team Jeff has at the University of Miami. Jeff has simultaneously received a combination of Proton Beam Radiation treatment and chemotherapy.  The chemotherapy will be a part of his life for a long time to come. While quite a bit of his medical needs have been covered by insurance, there are some items that have not been approved and have had to be paid out of pocket.  Proton Beam Radiation therapy, as opposed to standard radiation, is one of those items, as well as pain management treatment.  Jeff could use some very good friends and, fortunately, he has many great friends. If you are able to donate to a fund to help Jeffrey with his medical expenses, please click on the link below.  No amount is too small, and there is no pressure to donate at all. Your calls and visits are much appreciated.  Your prayers are more than enough. ",30041,250000,19-Oct-21
